[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/M.ver-1-red.svg)](#mver1) **The source code must be version controlled using [Git](https://git-scm.com).**

>Rationale
>: Version control is essential for collaborative development and change tracking. Git is the most popular version control system by a wide margin, many sophisticated web-based collaboration tools are available for it, and new developers will be immediately productive in your Git repository.

[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/M.ver-2-red.svg)](#mver2) **Provide a transparent, online contribution process based on pull requests and issues collection. The preferred platform is [GitHub](https://github.com).**

>Rationale
>: GitHub is one of the most-used repositories of open-source software that includes collaboration tools such as issue tracking, pull requests, and wikis. Pull requests allow project maintainers to review changes, comment, and iterate with developers before new features are committed to a code base. Pull requests and branching simplify management of large numbers of contributions (particularly contributions across teams), and they enable many features to be developed concurrently. The product maintainer can review code and associated test results before merging it into a public branch. Pull requests can also be linked to GitHub issues, which can be created by anyone.
