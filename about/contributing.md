LLNL welcomes contributions from the general public to our [open source projects on GitHub](https://github.com/llnl). Each of the projects maintains an [issue tracker](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) and is capable of accepting [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) from other users.

### Contributing

Refer to individual projects for their requirements on accepting contributions. In general though, we follow the "fork and pull" Git workflow model:

* Fork a repository
* Develop your changes in your fork
* Create a pull request to the "upstream" repository
* If approved, changes will be merged in by a repository maintainer

### Employees

If you are an LLNL employee and you are interested in joining the [LLNL GitHub organization](https://github.com/llnl) and appearing in the [member list](https://github.com/orgs/LLNL/people), please see the instructions on [Using GitHub](https://software.llnl.gov/about/using-github/) for setting up your account (including two-factor authentication) and joining the organization.
