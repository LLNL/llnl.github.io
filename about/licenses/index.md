*This page contains information meant for LLNL Employees with instructions for
how to mark their source code projects. It is not intended to serve as legal
advice.*

### Required Files

All LLNL software must contain the following files at the root of the source
code repository:

#### 1. README file

All projects shall have a `README.md` file at the root of the repository.
The `README.md` must contain the LLNL release number
(`LLNL-CODE-XXXXXX`). We recommend putting it at the bottom in a section
called "Release".  See
[this example](https://github.com/spack/spack#release).

Additionally, we recommend that all projects have the following sections:

- A description of your project.
- "Getting Started": Simple instructions for how to install and use your
  project.
- "Getting Involved": Information about mailing lists or other ways users
  connect with you and each other.
- "Contributing": Instructions for how you'd like people to contribute to
  your code.

The `.md` suffix stands for "markdown".  Markdown is a plain text format.
It's easy to read and write, but it also allows you to add simple
formatting and links so that your `README.md` will render nicely on
GitHub. Take a look at GitHub's
[markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
for the basics.  For inspiration, look at other projects' `README.md`
files at [software.llnl.gov](https://software.llnl.gov/), or take a look
at this
[simple README.md template](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2).

#### 2. NOTICE file

At the root of every source code repository shall be the following text in a
file named `NOTICE`:

```
{% include_relative NOTICE %}
```

#### 3. Open Source LICENSE file

One of the following files must be included at the top level of your repository
with the file name `LICENSE`. The only content which may be changed in the file
is the copyright year.

- [Apache 2.0 License with LLVM Exception](/about/licenses/apache-2.0-llvm-exception.txt)
- [Apache 2.0 License](/about/licenses/apache-2.0.txt)
- [BSD-3 License](/about/licenses/bsd-3-clause.txt)
- [GPL-2.0 License](/about/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt)
- [GPL-3.0 License](/about/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)
- [LGPL-2.1 License](/about/licenses/lgpl-2.1.txt)
- [MIT License](/about/licenses/mit.txt)

If your repository was approved for release under a different open source
license, the text of that license will be provided by the Innovation and
Partnerships Office.

If your project has more than one license, then you must include *all* of
the relevant licenses in your repository.  We recommend that you name
them with descriptive suffixes.  For example, if your project is dual
licensed under Apache-2.0 and MIT, you should have top-level
`LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT` files. Because GitHub does not
automatically detect multiple licenses, we recommend *also* adding a
top-level `COPYRIGHT` file with a summary of license details. GitHub's
"view license" link will then point to this file.  You can look at
[Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) and its `README.md`, `COPYRIGHT`,
and `LICENSE-*` files for an example of how to organize a project with
two licenses.

### Other Considerations

In addition to the required files above, you should read the following
sections and determine whether they apply to your code.

#### Contribution Policies

If you host your code publicly, you may receive contributions from
outside the lab.  You should consider documenting your contribution
policies in your `README.md` or in a
[`CONTRIBUTING.md` file](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/).
It is good practice to make the following details explicit:

- The license under which contributions should be made
- How to submit contributions (pull requests, branches, etc.)

With most open source projects, it is assumed that contributions are made
under the *same* license under which the project is distributed. For
example, if you distribute your project under the `MIT` license,
contributed code is assumed to be under that license as well. The
[Cardioid](https://github.com/llnl/cardioid) project makes this explicit
in its `README.md`:

```
Cardioid is distributed under the terms of the MIT license. All new
contributions must be made under this license.
```

If you want to provide instructions to your users that they should follow
when submitting code to your project, you can put these types of
instructions in a
[`CONTRIBUTING.md` file](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/).
This file typically deals more with workflow than with copyright or other
IP concerns. A link to this file is shown to users when they submit pull
requests.

#### SPDX

[SPDX](https://spdx.org/) is an emerging standard for concisely labeling
source code with license information.  While it is not a requirement, we
encourage you to use SPDX identifiers in your code, as they significantly
reduce the amount of license boilerplate included in each source file.

SPDX provides a standard
[list of license identifiers](https://spdx.dev/ids/) that can be
used to label code.  To use SPDX identifiers in your project, you should
find your license's short identifier in the list, and add a special
`SPDX-License-Identifier` line to your `README.md`. For example, if your
code is licensed under the `MIT` license like
[Cardioid](https://github.com/llnl/cardioid), you would add this at the
bottom of your README file:

```
SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
```

Additionally, you can use SPDX to label your source files. While not all
open source licenses require you to add license information to every
source file, for projects that do require a copy in every file, the SPDX
short headers are sufficient. For example, source files in
[Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) start with the following comment:

```python
# Copyright 2013-2018 Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC and other
# Spack Project Developers. See the top-level COPYRIGHT file for details.
#
# SPDX-License-Identifier: (Apache-2.0 OR MIT)
```

There are two interesting parts here. First, the copyright section
prominently mentions LLNS.  It also mentions other Spack developers, who
hold the copyright on the parts of the code they contributed.  The SPDX
line allows us to avoid pasting much longer license headers into each
file.  All together, this makes for a much shorter and more concise
header.

The Spack example mentions a
[`COPYRIGHT`](https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/COPYRIGHT) file
because Spack is dual-licensed (see above). If you just have a single
license, you can simply refer to the `LICENSE` file in your header.

For more information on using SPDX in your code, see the [SPDX website](https://spdx.org/licenses/).

#### Developer Certificate of Origin

As mentioned above, the default assumption for open source projects is
["inbound license = outbound license"](https://opensource.guide/legal/),
i.e., contributors provide their code under the same license under which
the code is distributed. If this is not enough assurance for your project,
you may elect to use the
[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/)
with your project.

In this model, you can require contributors to use Git's
[sign-off](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1962094/what-is-the-sign-off-feature-in-git-for)
feature to acknowledge the DCO.  This is NOT a license nor a CLA, but
instead is a positive assertion by the contributor that they are
authorized to make the contribution they are making.  You should document
your project's requirement of DCO sign-off in your `README.md` or your
[`CONTRIBUTING.md` file](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/).

You are not required to use the DCO, and it may add overhead to your
process that deters potential contributors.  Unless you feel that you
need this level of assurance for your project, we recommend that you
simply rely on the default inbound = outbound assumption.

#### Digital Object Identifier (DOI)

A digital object identifier (DOI) is a unique persistent identifier that 
references a digital object and provides long-term access. Just as journal 
articles carry DOIs, so too can open source software repositories.

The U.S. Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) assigns DOIs 
to software *after* your code has been submitted to [DOE CODE](https://www.osti.gov/doecode/faq#what-is). 
See OSTI's [FAQ on DOIs](https://www.osti.gov/doecode/faq#what-is-a-doi) for 
details about how DOIs work and why they are beneficial.

OSTI is evaluating a notification workflow that would let a developer know 
when a DOI has been assigned. Until then, you can find your repo's DOI *and* 
add it to the repo by following these steps:

1. Type in the name of your repo at [DOE CODE](https://www.osti.gov/doecode/), then select it.
2. Look in the RESOURCE section for the DOI number.
3. In the SAVE/SHARE section, click Export Metadata and download the YAML file.
4. Include that file in your repo in one of two ways:
- Create a [CITATION file](https://citation-file-format.github.io/)
- Add it to the [README file](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
