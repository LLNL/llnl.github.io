title: "Sandia Open-Source Simulator Helps Solve the Mysteries of Metal Hardening"
categories: story

HPC materials simulations at LLNL are revealing surprising insights into how metals behave under extreme pressure. Check out this research highlight on [metal hardening](https://str.llnl.gov/2018-09/bulatov) from _Science & Technology Review_. Using Vulcan and Sequoia, two of our most powerful computers, a research team leveraged the LAMMPS (Large-Scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) molecular dynamics simulator to run simulations of a corrosion-resistant metal called tantalum. Developed by our colleagues at Sandia National Laboratories, [LAMMPS](https://github.com/lammps/lammps) is an open-source code that allows users to study the physical movement of atoms and molecules.
