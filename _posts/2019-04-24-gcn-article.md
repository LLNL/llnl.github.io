LLNL's Ian Lee discusses the importance of open-source software and cloud computing for HPC centers and government agencies in this [GCN.com article](https://gcn.com/articles/2019/04/24/hpc-hybrid-cloud-open-source.aspx). He states, “We’ve been doing open source on big Unix systems for more than 20 years. Back then, if we produced open source software for our supercomputers, we were the only ones who could use that software. Now, the software can be ported out and mainstreamed, and it’s a lot easier to make use of supercomputing in other places.”
