[AutoParBench](https://github.com/LLNL/AutoParBench) is a benchmark framework to evaluate compilers and tools designed to automatically insert OpenMP directives. The project's goals are (1) to generate actionable information (e.g., bug reports and feature requests) for compiler and tool developers and (2) to drive the research for automatic parallelization using OpenMP, making OpenMP more declarative to reduce the burdens on OpenMP users. [AutoParBench documentation](https://github.com/LLNL/AutoParBench/tree/master/docs) is in progress.
