[AC2Dr](https://github.com/LLNL/AC2Dr) (Acoustic Codes in Spherical Coordinates) is a 2D numerical solver for the acoustic wave equation using the finite difference method. The acoustic wave equation is split into two first-order differential equations for pressure and particle velocity, and approximated by the sixth-order accurate central difference in space and time.
