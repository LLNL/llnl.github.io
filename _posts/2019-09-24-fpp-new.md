[FPP (Function Preserving Projection)](https://github.com/LLNL/fpp) is a linear projection technique for finding a 2D view that captures interpretable patterns of the given function in a high-dimensional domain. The function can be univariate or multivariate, continuous (regression), or discrete (classification).
