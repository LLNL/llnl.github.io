Learn how to use a modern, open-source HPC software stack! From mid-July to mid-September, the High Performance Computing Innovation Center will host free tutorials covering a wide range of HPC needs including package management, memory management, workflow management, portability, performance, visualization, math libraries, and more. Software teams will walk you through installation, configuration, and getting started. Attendees will be provided with AWS instances so that they can follow along with the tutorials in real time. All experience levels are welcome. Visit the [HPCIC website](https://hpcic.llnl.gov/2025-hpc-tutorials) for the schedule and sign-up link (registration closed in August).
