[Adiak](https://github.com/LLNL/Adiak) is a library for collecting metadata from HPC application runs, and distributing that metadata to subscriber tools. Adiak has a tool interface, which allows tools to subscribe to this metadata. Example tools might include performance analysis tools, workflow tracking tools, or anything else that needs this metadata. Tools can iterate receive metadata name/values as they are provided by the application, or examine existing metadata values.
