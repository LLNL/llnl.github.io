categories: release
---

[Version 3.4](https://mfem.org/download/) of MFEM, a lightweight, general, scalable C++ library for finite element methods, is now available.

The goal of MFEM is to enable high-performance scalable finite element discretization research and application development on a wide variety of platforms, ranging from laptops to [exascale supercomputers](http://exascaleproject.org/).

It has many features, including:

- 2D and 3D, arbitrary order H1, H(curl), H(div), L2, NURBS elements.
- Parallel version scalable to hundreds of thousands of MPI cores.
- Conforming/nonconforming adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), including anisotropic refinement, derefinement and parallel load balancing.
- Galerkin, mixed, isogeometric, discontinuous Galerkin, hybridized, and DPG discretizations.
- Support for triangular, quadrilateral, tetrahedral and hexahedral elements, including arbitrary order curvilinear meshes.
- Scalable algebraic multigrid, time integrators, and eigensolvers.
- Lightweight interactive OpenGL visualization with the MFEM-based [GLVis](http://glvis.org) tool.

Some of the [new additions in version 3.4](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/v3.4/CHANGELOG) are:

- Significantly improved non-conforming unstructured AMR scalability.
- Integration with PUMI, the [Parallel Unstructured Mesh Infrastructure](https://scorec.rpi.edu/pumi/) from RPI.
- Block nonlinear  operators and variable order NURBS.
- Conduit [Mesh Blueprint](http://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprint.html) support
- General "high-order"-to-"low-order refined" field transfer.
- New specialized time integrators (symplectic, generalized-alpha).
- Twelve new examples and miniapps.

MFEM is being developed in [CASC](https://casc.llnl.gov), [LLNL](https://www.llnl.gov) and is freely available under LGPL 2.1.
