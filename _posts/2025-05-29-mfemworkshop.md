The [MFEM](https://mfem.org) team invites you to the fifth annual [MFEM Community Workshop](https://mfem.org/workshop/) on Wednesday–Thursday, September 10–11. The event is free, virtual, and open to all (in-person at Portland State University).

Registration and abstract submissions close on August 27. Submit visualizations (images or videos) of MFEM-related simulations for a chance to win a t-shirt and be featured in the online gallery. We encourage students to submit a lightning talk.
