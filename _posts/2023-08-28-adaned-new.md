[Analytic_NED_Asteroid_Deflection_Model](https://github.com/LLNL/Analytic_Deflection_of_Asteroids_by_NEDs) evaluates an analytic formula for the Î” v imparted to an asteroid by a 1 or 2 keV black body source given the radius of the asteroid, the standoff distance, the Yield in x-rays, the density of the asteroid, and the fit coefficients for the 1 or 2 keV black body source (provided in the module). Three variations of the formula are given; the "original" form, the "corrected" form that accounts for the angle of incidence in calculating the melt depth, and a form based on an "impulse" model. Each formula is fit to simulations of spherical asteroids of uniform composition illuminated by black body x-rays.
