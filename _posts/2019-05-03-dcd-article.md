Artificial intelligence tools are revolutionizing scientific research and changing the needs of high performance computing. In an [article](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/analysis/how-machine-learning-could-change-science/) from Data Center Dynamics, LLNL's Fred Streitz and [Brian Van Essen](https://github.com/bvanessen) discuss the future of scientific computing, highlighting the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) and the Livermore Big Artificial Neural Network (LBANN).

The [ECP](https://exascale.llnl.gov/) is a multi-institutional Department of Energy collaboration aimed at achieving exascale computing capability. Many open source software projects, from LLNL and elsewhere, are crucial components of the ECP ecosystem.

[LBANN](https://github.com/LLNL/lbann) is an open source deep learning toolkit developed at the Lab. It provides model-parallel acceleration through domain decomposition to optimize for strong scaling of network training.
