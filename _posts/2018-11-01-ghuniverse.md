LLNL open-source champions [Laura Weber](https://github.com/LRWeber), [Ian Lee](https://github.com/IanLee1521), and [David Beckingsale](https://github.com/davidbeckingsale) attended the 2018 GitHub Universe conference in San Francisco. Billed as “a conference for the builders, planners, and leaders defining the future of software”, the team enjoyed hearing about upcoming GitHub enhancements and being able to network with GitHub Federal employees and other GitHub users.

One recurring theme was inner source, the use of open source software development best practices and the establishment of an open-source-like culture within organizations. With this practice the organization may still develop proprietary software, but internally opens up its development.
