LLNL Computing relies on engineers like Stephanie Brink to keep the legacy codes running smoothly. “You’re only as fast as your slowest processor or your slowest function,” says Stephanie, who works in the Center for Applied Scientific Computing. By analyzing a legacy code’s performance, Stephanie and her team can reduce the amount of time it takes to run and allow for more critical science to be accomplished. Stephanie is a frequent contributor to open source software, including [Hatchet](https://github.com/hatchet/hatchet) and [Variorum](https://github.com/slabasan/variorum).
