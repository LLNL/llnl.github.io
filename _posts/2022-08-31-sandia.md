title: "Sandia Leverages LLNL's Open Source Software for New Website"
categories: story
---

A Sandia software development team has launched a new website based on one of LLNL’s open-source projects. The new [software.sandia.gov](https://software.sandia.gov/) website (repository: [github.com/sandialabs/sandialabs.github.io](https://github.com/sandialabs/sandialabs.github.io)) serves as a portal into Sandia’s GitHub repositories, providing more than a dozen browsable categories alongside data visualizations of GitHub data—repository relationships, commit and pull request activity, common licenses, and more. Forked from this very website (repository: [github.com/LLNL/llnl.github.io](https://github.com/LLNL/llnl.github.io)), Sandia's site is also built on a Jekyll template and served via GitHub pages.
