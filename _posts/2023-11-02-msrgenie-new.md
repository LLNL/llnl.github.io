[MSR-Genie](https://github.com/LLNL/msr-genie) is a vendor-neutral tool for fast and efficient queries about model-specific registers (MSRs). The tool allows end users to query bi-directionally across MSR lists as well as processor families and models, and provides them with guidance on appropriate bitmasks.
