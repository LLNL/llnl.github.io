[MAT](https://github.com/LLNL/MAT), or Memory Analysis Tool, traces all memory accesses to stack(Static allocation)/heap(Dynamic allocation) on a trace run in a particular hardware and then estimates execution time on given arbitrary hardware configurations for hardware design space exploration. This repo is in its alpha version.
