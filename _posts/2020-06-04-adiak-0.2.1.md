[Adiak](https://github.com/LLNL/Adiak) is a library for collecting metadata from HPC application runs, and distributing that metadata to subscriber tools. Adiak has a tool interface, which allows tools to subscribe to this metadata. Version 0.2.1 adds handling for cases where Adiak is called with a MPI communicator before `MPI_Init`.
