[Babel](https://github.com/LLNL/Babel) is a language interoperability tool intended for use by the high-performance scientific computing community. It supports the Scientific Interface Definition Language (SIDL) for the language-independent declaration of interfaces associated with scientific software packages. Although the project is no longer funded, it has recently moved to GitHub for ease of access by the HPC community. [Babel documentation](https://software.llnl.gov/Babel/#page=home) is available.
