Exascale computing will transform the ability to tackle some of the world’s most important challenge. The Exascale Computing Project (ECP) celebrates this new era of scientific discovery with Exascale Day on October 18, or "10^18" to represent the exascale threshold of floating-point operations per second. This [virtual event](https://www.exascaleproject.org/exascale-day-2020/) will provide videos, audio discussions, and articles that will educate participants about impact areas of exascale computing from the Department of Energy national laboratories, HPC manufacturers, and leading universities and industrial organizations. LLNL will be participating, and much of the ECP's software stack is open source.

LLNL's highlights include:
