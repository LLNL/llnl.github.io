This is MemSurfer's initial release. MemSurfer is an efficient and versatile tool to compute and analyze membrane surfaces found in a wide variety of large-scale molecular simulations. MemSurfer works independent of the type of simulation, directly on the 3D point coordinates, and can handle a variety of membranes as well as atomic simulations. It provides many in-built analysis tasks, such as computing the membrane curvature, density and normals of lipids, and area per lipid.
