LANL led with LLNL contributors, Charliecloud provides user-defined software stacks for HPC centers. It uses Linux user namespaces to run containers with no privileged operations or daemons and minimal configuration changes on center resources.

This release contains two important new features:
- Completely unprivileged end-to-end workflow, with no root, no sudo, and no setuid/setcap helper programs
- SquashFS wrapper scripts to facilitate a workflow based on SquashFS files rather than tarballs
