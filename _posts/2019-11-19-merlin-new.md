[Merlin](https://github.com/LLNL/Merlin) is a tool for running machine learning based workflows. The goal of Merlin is to make it easy to build, run, and process the kinds of large scale HPC workflows needed for cognitive simulation. At its heart, Merlin is a distributed task queuing system, designed to allow complex HPC workflows to scale to large numbers of simulations. See the [Merlin documentation](https://merlin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information including configuration variables and FAQ.
