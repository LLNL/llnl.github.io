Leading high performance computing publication *HPCwire* [presented Spack developers](https://www.llnl.gov/article/50626/spack-receives-prestigious-hpcwire-award-sc23) with the Editor's Choice Award for Best HPC Programming Tool or Technology at SC23. [Spack](https://spack.io), a versatile, ubiquitous, and configurable package manager for HPC, was developed at LLNL and has become a standard bearer in the community. Recognized as the official deployment tool for the Department of Energy’s Exascale Computing Project, Spack has played a crucial role in running the world's first exascale machines at the Oak Ridge and Argonne national laboratories, and soon, the El Capitan exascale system at LLNL. Spack has also partnered with companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise and become the package manager of choice for many international supercomputing centers. For Todd Gamblin, the LLNL computer scientist who created Spack in 2013, the open-source Spack community is just getting started. “It’s great to get this recognition from *HPCwire*,” Gamblin said. “This project has been going for 10 years, and I think it’s become well-known among the developers in the HPC community. To support the diversity of use cases that we have, we have been trying hard to get some very complicated features into Spack to make it flexible, which will enable us to pursue more use cases and integrations with vendors.”
