 As the number of smart meters and the demand for energy is expected to increase by 50% by 2050, so will the amount of data those smart meters produce. While energy standards have enabled large-scale data collection and storage, maximizing this data to mitigate costs and consumer demand has been an ongoing focus of energy research. [GridDS](https://github.com/llnl/gridds) is an open source data science toolkit for power and data engineers that will provide an integrated energy data storage and augmentation infrastructure, as well as a flexible and comprehensive set of state-of-the-art machine learning models. By providing an integrative software platform to train and validate machine learning models, GridDS will help improve the efficiency of distributed energy resources, such as smart meters, batteries and solar photovoltaic units. GridDS also is designed to leverage advanced metering infrastructure, outage management systems data, supervisory control data acquisition, and geographic information systems to forecast energy demands and detect incipient grid failures.
