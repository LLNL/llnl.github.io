FGPU is a collection of code examples focusing on porting FORTRAN codes to run on GPU architectures. The repo includes learning aids for developers and a regression test for compilers supporting OpenMP4.5, OpenACC, CUDA FORTRAN, and more. While FGPU's examples have a heavy FORTRAN emphasis, some examples also include C++ usage. Check out the [FGPU GitHub repo](https://github.com/LLNL/FGPU) and [LLNL project summary](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/fgpu).
