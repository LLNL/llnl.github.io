FGPU is a collection of code examples focusing on porting FORTRAN codes to run on GPU architectures. The repo includes learning aids for developers and a regression test for compilers supporting OpenMP4.5, OpenACC, CUDA FORTRAN, and more. While FGPU's examples have a heavy FORTRAN emphasis, some examples also include C++ usage.
