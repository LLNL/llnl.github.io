The [MFEM](https://mfem.org) team hosted the fifth annual [MFEM Community Workshop](https://mfem.org/workshop/) on September 10-11, held for the first time at Portland State University. The goal of the workshop was to foster collaboration among all MFEM users and developers, share the latest MFEM features with the broader community, deepen application engagements, and solicit feedback to guide future development directions for the project.
