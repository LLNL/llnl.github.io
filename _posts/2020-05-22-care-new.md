[CHAI](https://github.com/LLNL/CHAI) and [RAJA](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA) provide an excellent base on which to build portable code for different computing architectures. [CARE](https://github.com/LLNL/CARE) expands on that functionality, adding new features such as loop fusion capability and a portable interface for many numerical algorithms. CARE provides all the basics for anyone wanting to write portable code.
