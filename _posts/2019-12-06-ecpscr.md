A software product called the [Scalable Checkpoint/Restart (SCR) Framework 2.0](https://github.com/LLNL/scr) recently won an [R&D 100 Award](https://www.rdworldonline.com/finalists-announced-for-2019-rd-100-awards/). SCR enables HPC simulations to take advantage of hierarchical storage systems, without complex code modifications.

In this [podcast episode](https://exascaleproject.org/rd-100-award-winning-software-enables-i-o-performance-portability-and-code-progress/) (12:18) produced by the [Exascale Computing Project](https://exascaleproject.org/), LLNL's Kathryn Mohror and Elsa Gonsiorowski talk about what SCR is and does, the challenges involved in creating it, and the impact it is expected to have on HPC performance.
