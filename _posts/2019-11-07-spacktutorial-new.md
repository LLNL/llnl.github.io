As part of Spack's [v0.13.0 release](https://github.com/spack/spack/releases/tag/v0.13.0), the tutorial has been broken out into [its own repo](https://github.com/spack/spack-tutorial) for easier archiving of versions from past events. The tutorial is available in [its own Read the Docs instance](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) while remaining navigable from Spack's [full RtD documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
