title: "Podcast: Software Enables Use of Distributed In-System Storage and Parallel File System"

For decades, HPC applications used a shared parallel file system for input/output (I/O), but the recent addition of new storage devices in systems&mdash;burst buffers, for example&mdash;has enabled the creation of a storage hierarchy. The hierarchy can be arranged such that in-system storage is the first level, and the parallel file system the second. For optimal performance, applications must change along with the architectures.

In this [podcast episode](https://exascaleproject.org/software-enables-use-of-distributed-in-system-storage-and-parallel-file-system/) (11:28) produced by the [Exascale Computing Project](https://exascaleproject.org/), LLNL's Kathryn Mohror and ORNL's Sarp Oral talk about the open source tool [UnifyFS](https://github.com/LLNL/UnifyFS), which can provide I/O performance portability for applications, enabling them to use distributed in-system storage and the parallel file system.
