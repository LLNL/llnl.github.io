The [LCOM Metric Analyzer](https://github.com/LLNL/ROSE-LCOM-Tools) evaluates the quality of object-oriented code by identifying classes that lack cohesion. These classes can be broken down into smaller, more manageable units for improved clarity and maintenance. Cohesion is measured using the various LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) metrics, and source code is processed using the [ROSE compiler](https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose) infrastructure.
