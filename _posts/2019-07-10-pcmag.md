PC Magazine recently featured LLNL's supercomputing facility to find out how the supercharged machines handle everything from virtual nuclear weapons tests to weather modeling. The article highlights examples of simulations performed on the Lab's computers, such as a fusion energy research experiment generated by the [MFEM](https://mfem.org/)-based [BLAST](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/blast) shock hydrodynamics code and visualized with [VisIt](https://sd.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit).
