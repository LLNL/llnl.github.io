To all computational scientists, mathematicians, scientists, and engineers interested in high-order methods and PDEs: Several institutions have joined together to organize the inaugural North American High Order Methods Conference (NAHOMCon19). The conference will be held in San Diego in the summer of 2019 and will focus on the many developments in high-order discretizations and applications taking place in North America.

The DOE co-design Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations (CEED) is pleased to participate in the conference. CEED is a partnership between two U.S. DOE laboratories (Livermore & Argonne) and five universities in support of the [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org/).
