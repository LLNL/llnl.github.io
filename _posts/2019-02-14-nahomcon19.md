To all computational scientists, mathematicians, scientists, and engineers interested in high-order methods and PDEs: Several institutions have joined together to organize the inaugural [North American High Order Methods Conference (NAHOMCon19)](https://www.nahomcon19.sdsu.edu/). The conference will be held in San Diego in the summer of 2019 and will focus on the many developments in high-order discretizations and applications taking place in North America.

The DOE co-design Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations (CEED) is pleased to participate in the conference. CEED is a partnership between two U.S. DOE laboratories (Livermore & Argonne) and five universities in support of the [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org/).
