LLNL's Center for Applied Scientific Computing ([CASC](https://computing.llnl.gov/casc)) serves as a window to the broader computer science, computational physics, applied mathematics, and data science research communities. A new [video](https://youtu.be/5CIeSLWs7hI) showcasing CASC's computational mathematics research debuted at the International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM) conference in July. Among the featured projects are open source repos [MFEM](https://mfem.org/), a library of scalable finite-element discretization and solver algorithms, and [XBraid] (https://github.com/XBraid/xbraid), a library of parallel-in-time solvers.
