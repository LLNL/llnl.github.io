The long-awaited Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) installer software [v3.0 beta release](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-installer/releases/tag/v3.0b1) is here!

LLNL's [William Hill](https://github.com/William-Hill) unveiled the beta at ESGF's annual conference in Washington, DC. His slides can be downloaded [here](https://esgf.llnl.gov/2018-F2F.html) -- look for the second link on Day 3.

v3.0  is a complete rewrite of the ESGF installation stack and includes a 2.x migration script to upgrade an existing node. This release addresses several long-standing problems such as a lack of error handling, lack of extensibility, and a complicated installation process. Note that the Conda environment must be activated to run this installer. [Documentation](http://esgf.github.io/esgf-installer/
) is updated accordingly.
