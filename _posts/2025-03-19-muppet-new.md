[MUPPET](https://github.com/LLNL/MUPPET) is a tool for OpenMP programs that identifies program modifications called mutations aimed at improving program performance. Existing performance optimization techniques, including profiling-based and auto-tuning techniques, fail to indicate program modifications at the source level thus preventing their portability across compilers. MUPPET aims to help HPC developers reason about performance defects and missed opportunities to improve performance at the source code level.
