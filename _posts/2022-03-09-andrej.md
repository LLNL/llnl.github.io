categories: story
---

Computational mathematician Julian Andrej began using LLNL-developed, open source software while in Germany. Now at Livermore, he lends his expertise to the Center for Applied Scientific Computing, developing code for next-generation computing hardware. "I know that every part of my work is contributing to a mission, and I can see a clear traceable path of its impact," he says. Andrej contributes to [MFEM](https://mfem.org/) and [SUNDIALS](https://github.com/LLNL/sundials) projects.
