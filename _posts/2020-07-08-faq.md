Much of the content under the [About section](/about/) of this website has been consolidated into an easy-to-navigate [FAQ page](/about/faq/). The FAQ explain how to get started on GitHub, become part of the LLNL organization, manage repositories, and much more. We encourage readers to provide feedback or new questions by contacting the [LLNL GitHub admins](mailto:github-admin@llnl.gov) or submitting a pull request.
