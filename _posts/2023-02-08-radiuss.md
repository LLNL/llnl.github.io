title: "Results from the First LLNL Developer Survey"
categories: story

With software development underpinning much of LLNL’s mission-driven science, the Lab’s developer community has a long history of figuring out solutions to a huge number of complex challenges. But how do we know what’s working and what isn’t? What tools or other support do developers need to do their best work? The [RADIUSS project](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/radiuss) team conducted a survey of LLNL developers in late 2022 to assess their happiness and needs, both for awareness and targeted action that might be pursued in the next year. Some of this insight has been published publicly for the purposes of knowledge sharing and community building. Additionally, since RADIUSS products are open source, external users can benefit from improvements LLNL makes internally and pushed out to publicly available projects.
