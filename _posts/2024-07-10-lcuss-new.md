Livermore Computing User and System Scripts ([LCUSS](https://github.com/LLNL/LCUSS)) is a collection of scripts used to improve productivity on HPC systems for both administrators and general users. These may include general scripts for user management, scripts for helping users interact with Livermore Computing (LC) resource management software (e.g., SLURM and Flux), and scripts to automate common user command-line tasks on LC and other HPC machines.
