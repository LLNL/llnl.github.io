A series of tutorials in collaboration with AWS returned this summer, demonstrating how to use several GPU-ready projects in the cloud and on premises. This year's sessions offered more tutorials featuring more open source software projects. The tutorials were open to everyone and held every week throughout August. Participants followed along on their own AWS EC2 instance (provided). No previous was experience necessary. Materials are accessible on the [RADIUSS website](https://software.llnl.gov/radiuss/event/2023/07/11/radiuss-on-aws/).
