The [MFEM](https://mfem.org) team invites you to the fourth annual [MFEM Community Workshop](https://mfem.org/workshop/) on Tuesday–Thursday, October 22–24. The event is free, virtual, and open to all.

Registration and abstract submissions close on October 15. Submit visualizations (images or videos) of MFEM-related simulations for a chance to win a t-shirt and be featured in the online gallery. Returning this year is the student showcase, so we encourage students to submit a 10-minute lightning talk.
