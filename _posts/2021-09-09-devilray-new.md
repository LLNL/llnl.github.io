[Devil Ray](https://github.com/LLNL/devil_ray) is a visualization and analysis library for high-order element meshes targeting modern HPC architectures. It runs on both GPUs and many-core CPUs and leverages MPI for distributed-memory computations. The repo supports meshes consisting of hexs, quads, tets, and triangles of arbitrary polynomial order, with fast paths for constant, linear, quadratic, and cubic elements. Originally architected as a ray tracer, Devil Ray is capable of rendering volumes and surfaces and has been demonstrated running concurrently on over 4,000 GPUs.
