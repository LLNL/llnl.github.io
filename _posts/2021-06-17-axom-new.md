[Axom](https://github.com/LLNL/axom) provides robust, flexible software infrastructure for the development of multi-physics applications and computational tools. Supported by the [Advanced Simulation and Computing](https://asc.llnl.gov/) program at LLNL and part of the Lab's [RADIUSS project](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/radiuss), Axom is a library of robust “building block” software components that provide foundational capabilities needed for production simulation codes. The Axom team focuses on developing software infrastructure components that can be shared by HPC applications running on diverse computing platforms.
