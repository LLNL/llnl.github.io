The [MFEM](https://mfem.org) team held the first annual [MFEM Community Workshop](https://mfem.org/workshop21/) on October 20. MFEM, which stands for Modular Finite Element Methods, is an open source [C++ software library](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/) that provides high-order mathematical algorithms for large-scale scientific simulations. The project’s discretization methods enable HPC systems to run these simulations more efficiently. More than 150 researchers from dozens of organizations and countries attended the one-day virtual workshop organized by Aaron Fisher, Tzanio Kolev, Will Pazner, and Mark Stowell. According to the registration survey, more than half of the participants were new users. An [article about the workshop](https://computing.llnl.gov/about/newsroom/mfem-team-hosts-first-community-workshop) is available on LLNL's Computing website, and links to videos of the presenters can be found at the MFEM website.
