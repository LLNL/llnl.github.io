[Gecko](https://github.com/LLNL/gecko) is a C++ library for solving graph linear arrangement problems. Gecko orders graph nodes, representing data elements, connected by undirected edges, representing affinity relations, with the goal of minimizing a chosen functional of edge length. Gecko was primarily designed to minimize the product of edge lengths but can also be used to reduce bandwidth (maximum edge length) and 1-sum (sum of edge lengths), among others. Documentation currently includes [FAQ](https://github.com/LLNL/gecko/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).
