Cardioid is a cardiac multiscale simulation suite spanning from subcellular mechanisms up to simulations of organ-level clinical phenomena. The suite contains tools for simulating cardiac electrophysiology, cardiac mechanics, torso-ECGs, cardiac meshing, and fiber-generation tools. 

This project's history goes back a few years -- it was a finalist for the 2012 Gordon Bell Prize -- but only now is the code available as open source. Initially developed by a team of LLNL and IBM scientists, Cardioid divides the heart into a large number of manageable subdomains. This replicates the electrophysiology of the human heart, accurately simulating the activation of each heart muscle cell and cell-to-cell electric coupling.
