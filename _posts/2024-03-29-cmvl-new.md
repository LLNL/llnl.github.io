The Continuous Monitoring Visualization Library ([CMVL](https://github.com/LLNL/cmvl)) is a broad collection of dashboards, visualizations, queries, and other components for common Logging/SIEM tools such as Elastic or Splunk. It contains useful examples of what can be built allowing for collaboration between DOE laboratories, across the federal government, and with industry partners on the most important components to monitor in an IT environment, particularly including, but not limited to, within HPC systems.
