[UnifyFS](https://github.com/LLNL/UnifyFS) is a user-level burst buffer file system under active development. The repo supports scalable and efficient aggregation of I/O bandwidth from burst buffers while having the same life cycle as a batch-submitted job. More than a year in the making, version 0.9.1 includes improved HDF5 and MPI-IO support, optimization to satisfy read requests from local, support for relative paths, additional unit and integration tests, and much more.
