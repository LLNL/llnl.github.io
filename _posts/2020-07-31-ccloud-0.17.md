LANL led with LLNL contributors, [Charliecloud](https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud) provides user-defined software stacks for HPC centers. It uses Linux user namespaces to run containers with no privileged operations or daemons and minimal configuration changes on center resources. Version 0.17 focuses on upgrades to `ch-grow` (e.g., diagnostics for syntax errors, “Lark” version compatibility, additional Dockerfile documentation).
