 The LLNL Automized Surface Titration Model ([L-ASTM](https://github.com/LLNL/LLNL-ASTM)) is a community data-driven surface complexation modeling workflow for simulating potentiometric titration of mineral surfaces. The model accepts raw experimental potentiometric titration data formatted in a findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) structure. The workflow was coded in Python and coupled to PHREEQC for surface complexation modeling and PEST for data fitting and parameter estimation.
