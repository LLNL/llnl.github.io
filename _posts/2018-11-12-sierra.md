LLNL recently unveiled the new 125-petaflop-capable [Sierra supercomputer](https://www.llnl.gov/news/lawrence-livermore-unveils-nnsa%E2%80%99s-sierra-world%E2%80%99s-third-fastest-supercomputer). Sierra will serve the NNSA’s three nuclear security laboratories: LLNL, Sandia National Laboratories, and Los Alamos National Laboratory, providing high-fidelity simulations in support of NNSA’s core mission of ensuring the safety, security, and effectiveness of the nation’s nuclear stockpile. Its arrival represents years of procurement, design, code development and installation, requiring the efforts of hundreds of computer scientists, developers and operations personnel working in close partnership with IBM, NVIDIA, and Mellanox.

Just a few weeks later, Sierra rose from third to second place on the TOP500 list of the world’s fastest computing systems after reaching 94.6 petaflops on the Linpack benchmark test. The latest rankings were [announced](https://www.llnl.gov/news/sierra-reaches-higher-altitudes-takes-no-2-spot-list-worlds-fastest-supercomputers) at SC18.
