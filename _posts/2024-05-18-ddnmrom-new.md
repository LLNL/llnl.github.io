[DD-NM-ROM](https://github.com/LLNL/DD-NM-ROM) integrates nonlinear-manifold reduced order models (NM-ROMs) with domain decomposition (DD). NM-ROMs approximate the full order model (FOM) state in a nonlinear-manifold by training a shallow, sparse autoencoder using FOM snapshot data. The code implementation was done using Python 3.9 and a CUDA-11.4 environment.
