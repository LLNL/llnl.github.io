Maestro Workflow Conductor is a lightweight Python tool that can launch multi-step software simulation workflows in a clear, concise, consistent, and repeatable manner. It does this locally as well as on supercomputers. LLNL Computing recently published a [project description](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/maestro-workflow-conductor), highlighting the challenges in scientific workflows that Maestro solves. “Before Maestro, it took a long time to stand up new workflows. Maestro has changed that by providing a consistent framework that can break down workflows into smaller pieces, and facilitate automated execution,” said project leader Frank Di Natale. Check out the [Maestrowf repo](https://github.com/LLNL/maestrowf).
