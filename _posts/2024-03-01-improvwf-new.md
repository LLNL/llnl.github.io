Improv Dynamic Workflows ([ImprovWF](https://github.com/LLNL/improvwf)) is a Python package for dynamic workflows, supplementing Maestro ([MaestroWF](https://github.com/LLNL/maestrowf)). A workflow is a series of dependent computations which are executed to yield an experimental result, much like sheet music describes a musical performance. Dynamic workflows are like improvisational jazz, in which the musicians create unique, situation-driven, collaborative variations on themes. Dynamic workflows can potentially yield better results, save computation, and/or save human decision-making effort versus pre-specified or manual workflows, as they need not run the exhaustive set of studies which might be required in a pre-specified set, and they make their own experimental design decisions at run time. If you have an existing Maestro study where you would like to save computation and/or human time, Improv is for you.
