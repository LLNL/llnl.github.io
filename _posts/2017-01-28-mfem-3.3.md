[Version 3.3](https://mfem.org/download/) of MFEM, a lightweight, general, scalable C++ library for finite element methods, is now available.

The goal of MFEM is to enable high-performance scalable finite element discretization research and application development on a wide variety of platforms, ranging from laptops to [exascale supercomputers](https://exascaleproject.org/).

It has many features, including:

- 2D and 3D, arbitrary order H1, H(curl), H(div), L2, NURBS elements.
- Parallel version scalable to hundreds of thousands of MPI cores.
- Conforming/nonconforming adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), including anisotropic refinement, derefinement and parallel load balancing.
- Galerkin, mixed, isogeometric, discontinuous Galerkin, hybridized, and DPG discretizations.
- Support for triangular, quadrilateral, tetrahedral and hexahedral elements, including arbitrary order curvilinear meshes.
- Scalable algebraic multigrid, time integrators, and eigensolvers.
- Lightweight interactive OpenGL visualization with the MFEM-based [GLVis](https://glvis.org) tool.

Some of the [new additions in version 3.3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfem/mfem/1569425857975d7c961b97d09c300da09aad9f82/CHANGELOG) are:

- Comprehensive support for the linear and nonlinear solvers, preconditioners, time integrators and other features from the [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc) and [SUNDIALS](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software) suites.
- Linear system interface for action-only linear operators including support for matrix-free preconditioning and low-order-refined spaces.
- General quadrature and nodal finite element basis types.
- Scalable parallel mesh format.
- Thirty-six new integrators for common families of operators.
- Sixteen new serial and parallel example codes.
- Support for CMake, on-the-fly compression of file streams, and HDF5-based output following the [Conduit](https://github.com/LLNL/conduit) mesh blueprint specification.

MFEM is being developed in [CASC](https://casc.llnl.gov), [LLNL](https://www.llnl.gov) and is freely available under LGPL 2.1.
