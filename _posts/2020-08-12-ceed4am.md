As part of the [Exascale Computing Project (ECP)](https://www.exascaleproject.org/), the [Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations (CEED)](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/) is a research partnership between two U.S. Department of Energy laboratories and five universities. LLNL leads the Center. All of [CEED's software](https://github.com/ceed/) is open source.

CEED held its 4th annual meeting on August 11-12 using ECP Zoom for videoconferencing and Slack for side discussions. The goals of the meeting were to report on the progress in the Center; deepen existing and establish new connections with ECP hardware vendors, ECP software technologies projects, and other collaborators; plan project activities; and brainstorm/work as a group to make technical progress. In addition to gathering together many CEED researchers, the meeting included representatives of ECP management, hardware vendors, software technology, and other interested projects. The full [meeting agenda](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/ceed4am/) is available on the CEED website.
