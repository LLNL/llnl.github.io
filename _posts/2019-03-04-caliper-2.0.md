Caliper is a program instrumentation and performance measurement framework. It is designed as a performance analysis toolbox in a library, allowing one to bake performance analysis capabilities directly into applications and activate them at runtime. Caliper is primarily aimed at HPC applications but works for any C/C++/Fortran program on Unix/Linux.

Functionality in v2.0 includes the new Channel API, which allows multiple, independent measurement configurations to be active at the same time.
