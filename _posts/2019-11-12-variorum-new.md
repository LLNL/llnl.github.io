[Variorum](https://github.com/LLNL/variorum) is a platform-agnostic library exposing monitor and control interfaces for several features in hardware architectures. It provides general interfaces to provide privileged functionality for monitoring and controlling various hardware-level features of multiple hardware architectures. Variorum provides vendor-neutral APIs such that the user can query or control hardware knobs without needing to know the underlying vendorâ€™s implementation. These APIs enable HPC application developers to gain a better understanding of performance through various metrics for the devices contained within the node. See the documentation for a [Quick Start Guide](https://variorum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
