title: "New Visualizations of Popular Repositories"

---

The [Visualize section](/visualize/) of this website has again expanded to include a [new page](/visualize/popular-repos/) that breaks down the popularity (i.e., stars) of LLNL repositories in a few ways: repos with the highest number of stars, creation history of those repos, increase of stars over time, commit activity of popular repos, and licenses of those repos. This new page, created by our 2020 summer intern, helps us better understand repos that have made a big impact in the open source community.
