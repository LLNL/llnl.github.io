[CHAI](https://github.com/LLNL/CHAI) is a C++ library providing an array object that can be used transparently in multiple memory spaces. CHAI can be used standalone, but is best when paired with the RAJA library, which has built-in CHAI integration that takes care of everything. This release requires the use of [RAJA v0.12.0](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/releases/tag/v0.12.0) and [Umpire v4.0.0](https://github.com/LLNL/Umpire/releases/tag/v4.0.0).
