The Coda Calibration Tool (CCT) calculates reliable moment magnitudes for small- to moderate-sized seismic events. The [v1.0.4 release](https://github.com/LLNL/coda-calibration-tool/releases/tag/1.0.4) includes several performance and stability improvements along with a few new features:

- Shared interaction between data plots and the map display
- Data point selection highlights relevant elements on the map (events/stations) and vice-versa
- Support for arbitrary user-defined lists of WMS 1.3.0-compliant map tile servers/layers for display on the map
- Automatic display of context-sensitive information based on which tab the user is actively looking at
