The [MFEM](https://mfem.org) team invites you to the third annual [MFEM Community Workshop](https://mfem.org/workshop/) on Thursday, October 26. The event is free, virtual, and open to all.

Registration & abstract submissions close on October 19. Submit visualizations (images or videos) of MFEM-related simulations for a chance to win a t-shirt and be featured in the online gallery. New this year is a student showcase, so we encourage students to submit a 5-minute lightning talk.
