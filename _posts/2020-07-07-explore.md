The [Explore section](/explore/) of this website is benefitting from new development by our summer intern. Data we collect from GitHub is visualized in various ways, with additional visualizations planned. These efforts help us understand our repos' activity, how they are being used, development trends, and more. Check out the new "Repo Licenses" viz and stay tuned for more!
