[FireCat](https://github.com/LLNL/firecat) performs multiscale simulations by coupling ab initio microkinetic simulations from CatMAP with two-dimensional continuum transport simulations from EchemFEM (Firedrake). This coupling is performed in an iterative fashion. The examples provided here are specific to electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO on Au electrodes.
