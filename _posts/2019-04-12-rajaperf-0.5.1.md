The RAJA performance suite (RAJAPerf) is designed to explore performance of loop-based computational kernels found in HPC applications. It is used to assess, monitor, and compare runtime performance of kernels implemented using RAJA and variants implemented using standard or vendor-supported parallel programming models directly.

v0.5.1 contains several documentation updates and changes to default CMake configuration so that RAJA tests and examples are not built unless explicitly turned on by passing the proper options to CMake.
