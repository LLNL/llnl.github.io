categories: multimedia
---

HPC developers build software from source code and optimize it for the targeted computer’s architecture. LLNL-developed [Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) handles the process of downloading a tool and all the necessary dependencies -- which can be tens or hundreds of other packages -- and assembles those components and ensures they are properly linked and optimized for the machine. Todd Gamblin, Spack’s lead developer, talks with the [Exascale Computing Project's](https://www.exascaleproject.org/) Exascale podcast. Both [audio](https://www.exascaleproject.org/spack-the-deployment-tool-for-ecps-software-stack/) and [video](https://youtu.be/H-QDo-hT3SY) versions are available. Total runtime is 13:54.
