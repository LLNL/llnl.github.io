Umap is a library that provides an mmap()-like interface to a simple, user- space page fault handler based on the userfaultfd Linux feature. The use case is to have an application specific buffer of pages cached from a large file (i.e. out-of-core execution using memory map). This release includes:

- Performance improvements
- Support for multiple umap regions
- Support for page prefetch
- Support for page read-ahead
