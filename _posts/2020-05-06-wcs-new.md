[WCS](https://github.com/LLNL/wcs) (short for Whole Cell Simulator) is a computational framework that enables seamless integration of diverse simulation methods used in creating a whole cell model (i.e., all the known biochemical processes in a cell). Its methods run simultaneously, not only for whole pathways but also for subsets of reactions.
