[PhyML](https://github.com/LLNL/PhyML) is a repository for the Python scripts for hard constrained sequential physics-informed neural networks (HCSPINNs). This method automatically enforces temporal continuity at time-window interfaces by using interpolation functions. See the README for relevant paper citations.
