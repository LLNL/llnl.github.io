LLNL’s [Seth Bromberger](https://github.com/orgs/LLNL/people/sbromberger) attended [JuliaCon 2019](https://juliacon.org) on July 22–25 in Baltimore, Maryland. He gave a talk on July 24 to a full house: “Using Julia in Secure Environments” ([abstract](https://pretalx.com/juliacon2019/talk/JANJFM/), [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/o8UBszD_zn4)). The focus of the presentation was engaging the community in thinking about transitive package dependencies and the security of the source code supply chain.

Other notable events at the conference included a keynote address by Steven Lee, applied mathematics program manager for Advanced Scientific Computing Research ([ASCR](https://www.energy.gov/science/ascr/advanced-scientific-computing-research)) within the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science. His presented his office's computing priorities and mentioned [related LLNL work](https://youtu.be/MF6K5ihilZc). In addition, LLNL’s [Jane Herriman](https://github.com/xorJane/Excelling-at-Julia-Basics-and-Beyond) received a [Julia Community Prize](https://juliacon.org/2019/prize.html) for her “teaching, outreach, and community stewardship.”

Conferences such as JuliaCon provide LLNL’s open source software community with opportunities for networking, collaboration, and technical skills development. Lab employees interested in attending similar events may contact Ian Lee for funding.
