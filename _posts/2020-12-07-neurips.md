The [34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)](https://nips.cc/) [features two LLNL papers](https://www.llnl.gov/archive/news/neurips-papers-aim-improve-understanding-robustness-machine-learning-algorithms) advancing the reliability of deep learning for the Lab's mission-critical applications. The most prestigious machine learning conference in the world, NeurIPS began virtually on December 6. The first paper describes a framework for understanding the effect of properties of training data on the generalization gap of machine learning (ML) algorithms&mdash;the difference between a model's observed performance during training versus its “ground-truth” performance in the real world. The second NeurIPS paper introduces an automatic framework to obtain robustness guarantees of any deep neural network structure using the open source [Linear Relaxation-based Perturbation Analysis (LiRPA)](https://github.com/KaidiXu/auto_LiRPA) repo. Developed with colleagues at Northeastern University, China’s Tsinghua University, and UCLA, LiRPA algorithms can provide guaranteed upper and lower bounds for a neural network function with perturbed inputs.
