Held since 2012, LLNL's hackathons are 24-hour opportunities to brainstorm, foster creativity, prototype, and explore. Participants work in groups or individually and often strive to learn new skills, programming languages, and tools in service to LLNLâ€™s missions. Like the spring and summer hackathons of 2020, this year's winter event (February 11-12) was held virtually using WebEx and Mattermost for collaboration. With LLNL's [Data Science Institute (DSI)](https://data-science.llnl.gov) sponsoring the hackathon, the agenda included guest speakers (below) discussing data science topics relevant to the Lab's missions as well as a deep learning tutorial. (Participants were not required to attend the talks.) [Read the recap on the DSI website.](https://data-science.llnl.gov/latest/news/winter-hackathon-highlights-data-science-talks-tutorial)
