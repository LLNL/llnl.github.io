title: "MFEM 3.3.2 Released"
categories: release
---

[Version 3.3.2](https://mfem.org/download/) of MFEM, a lightweight, general, scalable C++ library for finite element methods, is now available.

The goal of MFEM is to enable high-performance scalable finite element discretization research and application development on a wide variety of platforms, ranging from laptops to [exascale supercomputers](http://exascaleproject.org/).

MFEM has many features, including:

- 2D and 3D, arbitrary order H1, H(curl), H(div), L2, NURBS elements.
- Parallel version scalable to hundreds of thousands of MPI cores.
- Conforming/nonconforming adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), including anisotropic refinement, derefinement and parallel load balancing.
- Galerkin, mixed, isogeometric, discontinuous Galerkin, hybridized, and DPG discretizations.
- Support for triangular, quadrilateral, tetrahedral and hexahedral elements, including arbitrary order curvilinear meshes.
- Scalable algebraic multigrid, time integrators, and eigensolvers.
- Lightweight interactive OpenGL visualization with the MFEM-based [GLVis](http://glvis.org) tool.

Some of the [new additions in version 3.3.2](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/v3.3.2/CHANGELOG) are:

- Support for high-order mesh optimization based on the target-matrix optimization paradigm from the [ETHOS project](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/ethos-enabling-technologies-high-order-simulations).
- Implementation of the community policies in xSDK, the [Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development Kit](https://xsdk.info/).
- Integration with the [STRUMPACK](http://portal.nersc.gov/project/sparse/strumpack) parallel sparse direct solver and preconditioner.
- Several new [linear interpolators](http://mfem.org/lininterp/), five new examples and miniapps.
- Various memory, performance, discretization and solver improvements, including physical-to-reference space mapping capabilities.
- Continuous integration testing on Linux, Mac and Windows.

MFEM is being developed in [CASC](https://casc.llnl.gov), [LLNL](https://www.llnl.gov) and is freely available under LGPL 2.1.
