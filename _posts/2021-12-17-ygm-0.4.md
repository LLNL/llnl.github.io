[YGM](https://github.com/LLNL/ygm) is a general-purpose, pseudo-asynchronous communication library built on top of MPI in C++. The repo's utility is provided through its mailbox abstractions, which are used for point-to-point and broadcast communications. Releases v0.3 and v0.4 include new `ygm::container` functionality, API updates, improvements to subdependencies in CMake, and various performance improvements.
