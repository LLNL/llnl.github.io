Developed by LLNL and Portland State University researchers, innovative matrix-free solvers offer performance gains for complex multiphysics simulations. For faster computation, these solvers subdivide physical systems into a finite element space known as *H*(div). This type of discretization increases the number of finite elements while decreasing their sizeâ€”think of a 3D mesh breaking down into smaller and smaller squares while retaining a constant overall volume. *H*(div) is one of four finite element spaces in a set of differential equations known as the de Rham complex, all of which are incorporated into the Livermore-led [MFEM](https://github.com/mfem) (Modular Finite Element Methods) software library.
