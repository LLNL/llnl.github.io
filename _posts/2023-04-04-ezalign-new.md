[ezAlign](https://github.com/LLNL/ezAlign) provides coarse-grain to atomistic molecular coordinate and topology conversion for molecular dynamics simulations. ezAlign is designed to convert complex, solvated biological systems including lipid membranes with drug-like molecules using GROMACS. Single molecule coordinate, topology, and mapping may be specified during execution using the appropriate command-line options. A number of commonly simulated biological molecules are currently provided.
