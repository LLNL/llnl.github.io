[Spack](https://github.com/spack) is a flexible, configurable, Python-based, and open-source HPC package manager. Spack automates the installation and fine-tuning of simulations and libraries, operating on a wide variety of HPC platforms and enabling users to build many code configurations.

[In this video](https://youtu.be/D0p5xpsboK4), LLNL's [Todd Gamblin](https://github.com/tgamblin) and [Greg Becker](https://github.com/becker33) describe how Spack works and how its open source community has grown. They are joined by Lori Diachin, deputy director for the U.S. Department of Energy's [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org/), or ECP, who explains Spack's value to the ECP software stack.
