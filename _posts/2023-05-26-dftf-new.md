[DFTF](https://github.com/LLNL/dftf), or Drink From The Firehose, is a Python program that subscribes to Redfish events on Cray/HPE hardware and republishes them to topics in Kafka. In an attempt to tame the "firehose" of information from CrayTelmetry, DFTF drops any repeated metrics so only the most recent value for each unique metric is maintained. In effect, this usually means values are reported roughly every five seconds rather than every second. DFTF is being used during Livermore Computing's efforts to site the Lab's upcoming exascale machine El Capitan.
