Held since 2012, LLNL's hackathons are 24-hour opportunities to brainstorm, foster creativity, prototype, and explore. Participants work in groups or individually and often strive to learn new skills, programming languages, and tools in service to LLNLâ€™s missions. This year's spring event (May 26-27) will be held in person at the [Livermore Valley Open Campus](https://lvoc.org/). Sponsors are two Computing divisions: Enterprise Applications Services and National Ignition Facility Computing.
