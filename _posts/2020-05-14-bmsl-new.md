[BMSL](https://github.com/LLNL/bmsl), the Bayesian Multitask with Structure Learning model, is a repository that accompanies a paper: "[Bayesian Multitask Learning Regression for Heterogeneous Patient Cohorts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590177X19300587)" from the *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*. Multitask learning (MTL) is a sub-field of machine learning in which individual models for performing potentially related tasks are learned jointly. The Bayesian MTL model infers the task relationship structure directly from the data.
