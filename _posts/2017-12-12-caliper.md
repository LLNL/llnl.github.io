title: "Caliper: Application Introspection System"
categories: story
---

Comprehensive understanding of performance behavior of large-scale simulations requires the ability to compile, analyze, and compare measurements and contexts from many independent sources. Caliper, a general-purpose application introspection system, makes that task easier by acting as the “glue” that connects various independent context annotations, measurement services, and data processing services.
