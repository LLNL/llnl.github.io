[CHAI](https://github.com/LLNL/CHAI) is a C++ library providing an array object that can be used transparently in multiple memory spaces. CHAI can be used standalone, but is best when paired with the RAJA library, which has built-in CHAI integration that takes care of everything. This release includes support for global callbacks and pinned host memory. The Umpire submodule has also been updated to v2.1.0.
