title: "CEED’s Impact on Exascale Computing Project Efforts Is Wide-Ranging"
categories: release
---

The Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations (CEED) within the US Department of Energy’s ECP is helping applications leverage future architectures by developing state-of-the-art discretization algorithms that better exploit the hardware and deliver a significant performance gain over conventional methods. The focus is on high-order methods for high-fidelity and better machine utilization, with a range of orders providing flexibility in uncertain hardware and software environments.

The recent release of [CEED v2.0](https://www.exascaleproject.org/ceeds-impact-on-exascale-computing-project-ecp-efforts-is-wide-ranging/) includes many open source projects such as 12 integrated Spack packages for libCEED, MFEM, Nek5000, NekCEM, Laghos, NekBone, HPGMG, OCCA, MAGMA, gslib, PETSc, and PUMI, plus an updated CEED “meta-package.”
