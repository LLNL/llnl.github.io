Discrete resource event modeling and multi-cluster scheduling simulator ([DR_EVT](https://github.com/LLNL/dr_evt)) aims to provide a computational environment for simulating job scheduling and resource management using a set of heterogeneous clusters. Currently, the repo provides means to load and process job trace files, and the team is working on a workload model based on the trace data. DR_EVT is designed for Linux-based systems and contains information specific to Livermore Computing (LC) platforms.
