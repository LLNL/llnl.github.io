The new [Copson Expansion Solution](https://github.com/LLNL/Copson_Expansion_Solution) repo provides code to evaluate Copson's solution for the expansion of an ideal gas into vacuum. A [draft journal article](https://github.com/LLNL/Copson_Expansion_Solution/blob/master/MultiMat2019_Managan.pdf) is included for context about this physics problem.
