Compiler optimizations can alter significantly the numerical results of scientific computing applications. When numerical results differ significantly between compilers, optimization levels, and floating-point hardware, these numerical inconsistencies can impact programming productivity. [pLiner](https://github.com/LLNL/pLiner) is a framework that helps programmers identify locations in the source of numerical code that are highly affected by compiler optimizations. It uses a novel approach to identify such code locations by enhancing the floating-point precision of variables and expressions.
