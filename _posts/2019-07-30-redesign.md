title: "Software Portal Redesign and GitHub Integration"
categories: this-website
---

Recently this website received several changes that improve the user's experience, keep the content fresh, and help the admin team monitor and track all repositories under the LLNL organization on GitHub. We are excited to improve user access to LLNL's 500+ open source repositories and appreciate the help of our summer intern, Angela Flores, who is pursuing a B.S. in computer science with a minor in cybersecurity from Cal State Long Beach.

New website features include:
- [Home page](https://software.llnl.gov/) leaderboard image
- Dynamic catalog navigation by [categories](https://github.com/LLNL/llnl.github.io/tree/main/category) and their "overflow" pages (e.g., [Applications](https://software.llnl.gov/category/#/APPLICATIONS))
- Standardized use of topic tags on repos, which drive the categories
- [RADIUSS catalog](https://software.llnl.gov/radiuss/),* a subset of the full catalog
- Embedded Twitter feed on the [News](https://software.llnl.gov/news/) and [News Archive](https://software.llnl.gov/news/archive/) pages
- Automatic twice-daily GitHub data update, which updates the repos listed under each category as well as the visualizations on the [Explore](https://software.llnl.gov/explore/) page
- and [much more](https://github.com/orgs/LLNL/projects/4)!

*LLNL's RADIUSS project&mdash;Rapid Application Development via an Institutional Universal Software Stack&mdash;aims to broaden usage across LLNL and the open source community of a set of libraries and tools used for HPC scientific application development.
