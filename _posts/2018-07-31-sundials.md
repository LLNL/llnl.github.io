SUNDIALs consists of six solvers and is implemented with the goal of providing robust time integrators and nonlinear solvers that can easily be incorporated into existing simulation codes. We have created a robust [portal](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials) for users that includes documentation, usage notes, related publication, support information, and [downloads](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software). Detailed [release history](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/release-history) is available. Users can also fork the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/LLNL/sundials).
