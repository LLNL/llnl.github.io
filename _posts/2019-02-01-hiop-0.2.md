HiOp is an optimization solver for solving certain mathematical optimization problems expressed as nonlinear programming problems. This lightweight HPC solver leverages application's existing data parallelism to parallelize the optimization iterations by using specialized linear algebra kernels.

HiOp's initial release occurred in December 2017. This v0.2 includes:

- Implementation of various strategies to deal with fixed variables
- Comprehensive testing and bug fixing for MacOS
- Minor fixes of bugs found on various HPC platforms
- Minor interface and options refinement required by the integration with MFEM mesh optimization interface
