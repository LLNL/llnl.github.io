LLNL's [computing website](https://computing.llnl.gov) recently underwent a major overhaul to its design and information architecture. The site now features a taxonomy of Focus Areas that connect related content. These topics are tagged on News, People Highlights, and Projects. One of the topics is [open source software](https://computing.llnl.gov/topic/open-source-software). The site's [Livermore Computing page](https://computing.llnl.gov/livermore-computing) also directs users to this website for more information about open source projects.
