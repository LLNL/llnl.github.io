[Bridge Kernel](https://github.com/LLNL/bridge-kernel) is a Jupyter kernel for connecting to backends that implement the bridge kernel (bk) protocol. The bk protocol is a small client-server protocol that emphasizes minimal dependencies, easier embedding with MPI, secure connections, secure authentication, and automatic tunneling.
