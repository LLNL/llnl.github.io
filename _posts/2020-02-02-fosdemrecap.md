FOSDEM is an annual two-day event promoting the widespread use of free and open source software. The 2020 conference took place in Brussels, Belgium, on February 1–2. Videos of speakers, lightning talks, and other sessions are available on the [FOSDEM website](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/events/). LLNL's Todd Gamblin led two sessions about the package manager [Spack](https://github.com/spack):
