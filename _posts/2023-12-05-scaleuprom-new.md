[scaleupROM](https://github.com/LLNL/scaleupROM) is a projection-based reduced order model (ROM) with discontinuous Galerkin domain decomposition (DG-DD). It aims to construct a robust, efficient, large-scale ROM that is trained only from small scale component samples, for various physics partial differential equations.
