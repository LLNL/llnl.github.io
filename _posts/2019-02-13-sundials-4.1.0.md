title: "SUNDIALS 4.1.0 Released"
categories: release
---

In this release:
- Added an additional N_Vector implementation for Tpetra vector from Trilinos library (user docs and examples are updated to reflect this)
- Fixed a bug where a nonlinear solver object could be freed twice in some use cases
- Fixed a bug in ARKodeButcherTable_Write when printing a Butcher table without an embedding
- Removed EXAMPLES_ENABLE_RAJA CMake option

Important notes:
- The implementation header files (e.g., arkode_impl.h) are no longer installed. Users who are directly manipulating package memory structures will need to update their code to use the packageâ€™s public API.
- Python is no longer required to run make test and make test_install.
