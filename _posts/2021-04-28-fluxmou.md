Under a new memorandum of understanding, researchers at LLNL, IBM, and Red Hat will aim to enable next-generation workloads by integrating LLNL’s open source [Flux scheduling framework](http://flux-framework.org/) with Red Hat OpenShift to allow more traditional HPC jobs to take advantage of cloud and container technologies. “Cloud systems are increasingly setting the directions of the broader computing ecosystem, and economics are a primary driver,” said Bronis de Supinski, CTO of Livermore Computing at LLNL. “With the growing prevalence of cloud-based systems, we must align our HPC strategy with cloud technologies, particularly in terms of their software environments, to ensure the long-term sustainability and affordability of our mission-critical HPC systems.” [Read more about the agreement at LLNL News.](https://www.llnl.gov/article/47511/llnl-ibm-red-hat-joining-forces-explore-standardized-hpc-resource-management-interface)
