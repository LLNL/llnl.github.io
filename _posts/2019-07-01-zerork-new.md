Zero-Order Reaction Kinetics, or [Zero-RK](https://github.com/LLNL/zero-rk) is a software package that simulates chemically reacting systems in a computationally efficient manner. The fundamental advance embodied in Zero-RK is the numerical approach, which results in orders-of-magnitude reduction in simulation time while maintaining the accuracy of the results.
