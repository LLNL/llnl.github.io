[Simplexdesign](https://github.com/LLNL/simplexdesign) is a collection of tools for the design of statistical experiments on Agent Based Models. It includes a coordinate exchange algorithm for homogeneous agents and, more generally, any simplex. The repo also includes an optimization algorithm for the case with multiple classes of homogeneous agents.
