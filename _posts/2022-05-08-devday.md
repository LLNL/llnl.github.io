LLNL's sixth annual Developer Day is scheduled for July 21 in a hybrid format. Dev Day brings together software developers from across the Lab, highlighting projects under development and sharing best practices. Presentations will fall into two categories: (1) 5-minute lightning talks that cover an interesting discovery related to software, and (2) 15-minute quick takes on various topics. A career-focused panel discussion will also be part of the day's agenda. [Read a recap](https://computing.llnl.gov/about/newsroom/dev-day-makes-most-virtual-format) of last year's virtual event.
