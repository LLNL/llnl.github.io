Sponsored by the Computing Directorate, Developer Day is a chance for LLNL software developers to share ideas, learn about the latest technology, discuss best practices, and mingle with colleagues. During the COVID-19 pandemic, however, much of the Lab’s workforce is working remotely. On July 30, Computing’s fourth annual Dev Day was held virtually for the first time with more than 90 attendees—almost as many as attended last year in person. Organizers were Kyle Dickerson, Elsa Gonsiorowski, and David Beckingsale.
