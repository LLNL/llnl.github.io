Energy systems and their associated information and communication technology systems are becoming increasingly intertwined. As a result, effectively designing, analyzing, and implementing modern energy systems increasingly relies on advanced modeling that simultaneously captures both the cyber and physical domains in combined simulations. It is designed to increase scalability and portability in modeling advanced features of highly integrated power system and cyber-physical energy systems.

LLNL's Hierarchical Engine for Large-scale Infrastructure Co-Simulation ([HELICS](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS)) was originally developed for electric power systems use cases, and now it can be used for co-simulation in other domains. The HELICS library provides a general-purpose, modular, highly-scalable co-simulation framework that runs cross-platform. A new repository has been added to the HELICS suite, [HELICS-FMI](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-FMI), which allows functional mockup units to interact with HELICS.
