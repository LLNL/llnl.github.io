[Remote Mirror Security](https://github.com/LLNL/remote-mirror-security) (RMS) provides a framework for building git hooks that apply logic to secure changes from remote mirrors. The project relies on the `update.d` git hook to evaluate inbound repository changes. More details and documentation will be forthcoming!
