VisIt is an open source, cross platform, interactive, scalable, visualization and analysis tool for simulation data. VisIt 2.12.3 is primarily a bug fix release.

2.12.3 release highlights:

- The ANSYS reader was improved to support more general kinds of NBLOCK format strings.
- The GUI performance was improved on databases with large numbers of variables.
- A bug was corrected with query-over-time where it would yield different results in certain instances than repeatedly changing the time state and querying the value.
- A couple of bugs were corrected with the Silo reader.
