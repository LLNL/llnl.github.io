LLNL staff are heading to Dallas, Texas, for the 30th annual Supercomputing Conference (SC18) on November 11–16. LLNL is leading 6 tutorials and 16 workshops with topics ranging from data analytics and data compression to performance analysis and productivity. LLNL-developed open-source tools [Flux](https://github.com/flux-framework) and [Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) are subjects of a workshop and a tutorial, respectively. We hope to see you there!
