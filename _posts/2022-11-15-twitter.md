The [@Livermore_Comp](https://twitter.com/Livermore_Comp) account hosted a Twitter Space during the 34th annual [Supercomputing Conference (SC22)](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/) on November 15. LLNL's Meg Epperly moderated a panel featuring Elsa Gonsiorowski ([SCR](https://github.com/LLNL/scr) and other projects), Greg Becker ([Spack](https://spack.io/)), and David Gardner ([SUNDIALS](https://github.com/LLNL/sundials)). The panel discussed answered questions about why open source software is important for HPC centers, who benefits from using and contributing to it, and why LLNL actively develops and nurtures open source software.
