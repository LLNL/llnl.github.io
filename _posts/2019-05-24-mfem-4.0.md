[Version 4.0](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/v4.0/CHANGELOG) of [MFEM](https://mfem.org), a lightweight, general, scalable C++ library for finite element methods, is now available.

The goal of MFEM is to enable high-performance scalable finite element discretization research and application development on a wide variety of platforms, ranging from laptops to [exascale supercomputers](http://exascaleproject.org/).

For the first time ever, MFEM-4.0 adds support for GPU acceleration in the library:

- Device kernels can be written in CUDA, [OCCA](https://libocca.org/#/), [RAJA](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA) or OpenMP.
- Several examples [have been ported](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/v4.0/examples/ex1.cpp) with minimal code changes.
- Many linear algebra and finite element operations can use device acceleration by simply replacing loops with the [MFEM_FORALL](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/v4.0/general/forall.hpp) macro.
- The library provides seamless device/host [memory management](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/v4.0/general/mem_manager.hpp).

Some [other new additions in version 4.0](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/v4.0/CHANGELOG) are:

- Partially assembled finite element operators in the core library.
- Support for wedge/prism elements and meshes with mixed element types.
- General "low-order refined"-to-"high-order" field transfer.
- Seven new examples and miniapps.

The MFEM library has many more features, including:

- 2D and 3D, arbitrary order H1, H(curl), H(div), L2, NURBS elements.
- Parallel version scalable to hundreds of thousands of MPI cores.
- Conforming/nonconforming adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), including anisotropic refinement, derefinement and parallel load balancing.
- Galerkin, mixed, isogeometric, discontinuous Galerkin, hybridized, and DPG discretizations.
- Support for triangular, quadrilateral, tetrahedral and hexahedral elements, including arbitrary order curvilinear meshes.
- Scalable algebraic multigrid, time integrators, and eigensolvers.
- Lightweight interactive OpenGL visualization with the MFEM-based [GLVis](http://glvis.org) tool.

MFEM is being developed in [CASC](https://casc.llnl.gov), [LLNL](https://www.llnl.gov) and is freely available under LGPL 2.1.
