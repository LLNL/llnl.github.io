The [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org/), a joint effort between the DOE Office of Science and NNSA, brings together several national laboratories to address many hardware, software, and application challenges inherent in the organizationsâ€™ scientific and national security missions. The ECP's annual meeting was held virtually this year on April 12-16. Several sessions are available in a [dedicated YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF590mYJUDzLEalO05fJHX99cbbUOd-1e). LLNL's highlights feature open source projects that are crucial to the ECP's collaborative goals:

* [Spack BoF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDriIk5oTbY&list=PLF590mYJUDzLEalO05fJHX99cbbUOd-1e&index=4) (runtime 1:00:40): This "birds of a feather" gathering details major developments in [Spack](https://spack.io/) releases, collaborative work with the [E4S](https://e4s-project.github.io/) team, roadmap for future development, and results from a [community survey](https://spack.io/spack-user-survey-2020/).
* [Using Spack to Accelerate Developer Workflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlczUgwFCJg&list=PLF590mYJUDzLEalO05fJHX99cbbUOd-1e&index=9) (runtime 6:14:42): This tutorial focuses on developer workflows, covering covered installation, package authorship, Spack's dependency model, and Spack environments and configuration. Participants can learn new skills in this tutorial, even if they have participated in Spack tutorials in the past.
* [Characterizing Performance Improvements in the Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6bo48SaINU&list=PLF590mYJUDzLEalO05fJHX99cbbUOd-1e&index=7) (runtime 1:00:04, CEED section begins at 25:05): Speakers from ECP Application Development areas talked about how they set figures of merit, determined key performance parameters, and calculated efficiency of codes. [CEED](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/) is a co-design center led by LLNL and focusing on discretization algorithms that better exploit the hardware and deliver a significant performance gain over conventional low-order methods. The video concludes with a panel discussion with the speakers.
* [Using Flux to Overcome Scheduling Challenges of Exascale Workflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKVXNiz2F04) (runtime 2:16:48): The Flux team provides an in-depth tutorial that demonstrates how Flux is used in challenging HPC workflows, how to unify Flux with other scheduling and resource management software tools, and how Flux's job and resource model works, along with hands-on uses cases and testing.
