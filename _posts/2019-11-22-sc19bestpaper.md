On November 22, a panel of judges at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC19) awarded a multi-institutional team led by LLNL computer scientists with the conference’s Best Paper award. The [team's paper](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~hbhatia/pubs/2019_SC_MUMMI.pdf), entitled “Massively Parallel Infrastructure for Adaptive Multiscale Simulations: Modeling RAS Initiation Pathway for Cancer,” describes the workflow driving a first-of-its-kind multiscale simulation on predictively modeling the dynamics of RAS proteins&mdash;a family of proteins whose mutations are linked to more than 30 percent of all human cancers&mdash;and their interactions with lipids, the organic compounds that help make up cell membranes.

The team’s software, called MuMMI (Multiscale Machine-Learned Modeling Infrastructure), will soon be released as open source. [Read more about the award on LLNL news.](https://www.llnl.gov/news/llnl-led-team-awarded-best-paper-sc19-modeling-cancer-causing-protein-interactions)
