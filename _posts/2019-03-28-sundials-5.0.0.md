categories: release

SUNDIALS is a SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers. In this release, an additional N_Vector implementation, NVECTOR_MANYVECTOR, was created to support flexible partitioning of solution data among different processing elements (e.g., CPU + GPU) or for multi-physics problems that couple distinct MPI-based simulations together. Eleven new optional vector operations have also been added to the N_Vector API to support the new NVECTOR_MANYVECTOR implementation.
