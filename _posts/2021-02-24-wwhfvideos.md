LLNL computer engineer Ian Lee presented at Wild West Hackin' Fest (WWHF) 2020, and both of his talks are now available on YouTube:

- [Intro to Git for Security Professionals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8uMsXJWuRI) (2:01:58). This workshop provides an overview and introduction to the version control system Git for security professionals who may have no background in software development and who would like to start using their favorite open source tool.
- [Releasing Your First (Python) Open Source Project to the Masses!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czupb5lzPZI) (2:08:02). This video picks up from having just learned how to start using Git, and works through how to take that knowledge to start your own first open source project. This Hackin' Cast is appropriate for attendees of all levels, and no prior knowledge (other than very basic command line and git usage) is expected.

WWHF offers high-quality information security education to beginners and seasoned professionals alike. A stated goal is to lower the barrier to entry for those seeking to enter into the world of information security.
