[ez-Quench](https://github.com/LLNL/ez-Quench) is a simple model for jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions. The ez-Quench package consists of a set of Python routines that fit a simple model for jet energy-loss (jet-quenching) in heavy-ion collisions measured by experiments at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
