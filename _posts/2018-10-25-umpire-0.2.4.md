[Umpire](https://github.com/LLNL/Umpire) is a resource management library that allows the discovery, provision, and management of memory on next-generation architectures. It uses CMake and [BLT](https://github.com/LLNL/blt) to handle builds. New features in this version include:
- Support for allocating "constant" memory on CUDA GPUs
- A way of toggling introspection, to improve performance for allocators where you don't need tracking

Fixes and enhancements in [v0.2.4](https://github.com/LLNL/Umpire/releases/tag/v0.2.4):
- Ability to deallocate nullptr
- Fixed a bug when compiling with clang that would cause problems in the AllocationMap
- Ensured all classes with virtual functions have virtual destructors
