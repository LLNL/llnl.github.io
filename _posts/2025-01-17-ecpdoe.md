LLNL employees participating in three project teams were recently recognized with Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary’s Honor Awards. Among them was the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) leadership team, which successfully delivered the ECP, a 7-year, $1.8 billion collaboration among six DOE national laboratories to create the world’s first sustainable exascale ecosystem, resulting in the development and enhancement of 25 scientific application codes to provide breakthrough simulation results on exascale computers. Additionally, over 70 software technology products were delivered in an integrated package widely used by the high-performance computing community. This first-of-a-kind software research, development and deployment (RD&D) project was jointly managed by the DOE Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration, with leadership from Argonne, Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge and Sandia National Laboratories. ECP also established public-private partnerships by funding computer vendors to prepare the U.S. industry for exascale system procurements, enhancing U.S. competitiveness in the global computing market. The legacy of ECP will be felt for decades through its delivered products, trained staff and best practices in leading large, collaborative RD&D software projects.
