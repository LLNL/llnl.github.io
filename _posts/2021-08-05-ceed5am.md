As part of the Exascale Computing Project ([ECP](https://www.exascaleproject.org/)), the Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations ([CEED](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/)) is a research partnership between two U.S. Department of Energy laboratories and five universities. LLNL leads the Center. All of [CEED's software](https://github.com/ceed/) is open source.

CEED held its fifth annual meeting ([CEED5AM](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/ceed5am/)) virtually on August 3-4. The goals of the meeting were to report on recent progress; deepen existing and establish new connections with ECP hardware vendors, ECP software technologies projects, and other collaborators; plan project activities; and work as a group to make technical progress. Presentations covered activities related to GPU support and GPU-enabled solvers, high-order methods and finite elements, software products including the AmgX linear solver library and [libCEED](https://github.com/CEED/libCEED) algebraic library, [benchmarking](https://github.com/CEED/benchmarks) and optimization, various types of simulations enabled by CEED development, and much more.

Attendance included 97 researchers from 36 organizations:

- 8 national labs
- 20 universities
- 8 industry
