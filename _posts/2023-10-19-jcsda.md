In 2021, the U.S. Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) began exploring [Spack](https://spack.io) as an option for creating a single software stack that could be used for both the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) software environment and the Unified Forecast System (UFS) ecosystem.
