[Quicksilver](https://github.com/LLNL/Quicksilver) is a proxy application that represents some elements of the Mercury workload by solving a simpliÔ¨Åed dynamic Monte Carlo particle transport problem. Quicksilver attempts to replicate the memory access patterns, communication patterns, and the branching or divergence of Mercury for problems using multigroup cross sections. OpenMP and MPI are used for parallelization. [Documentation](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/co-design/quicksilver) is available.
