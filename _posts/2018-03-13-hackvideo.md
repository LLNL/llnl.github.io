As this [video](https://youtu.be/Oo207nA5mbo) demonstrates, thrice-yearly hackathons at LLNL provide 24-hour opportunities to brainstorm, foster creativity, prototype, and explore. Participants work in groups or individually to learn new skills, languages, and tools. Many hackers use the time to use open-source tools and contribute to the open-source community.
