categories: event
---

Held since 2012, LLNL's hackathons are 24-hour opportunities to brainstorm, foster creativity, prototype, and explore. Participants work in groups or individually and often strive to learn new skills, programming languages, and tools in service to LLNL’s missions. This year's spring hackathon (April 30 through May 1) will be held virtually. In true hackathon spirit, several tech solutions will enable participants to collaborate remotely. Charalynn Macedo, division leader for LLNL's Enterprise Applications Services, will kick off the event with a brief keynote presentation.
