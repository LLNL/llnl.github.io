[SPIFY](https://github.com/LLNL/spify), which stands for Spify Parser of Input Files with YAML syntax, is a C++ library for parsing input files to be used in scientific computing applications. The library allows an application developer to define a full set of required and optional input variable of different types and handles all of the parsing and validation.
