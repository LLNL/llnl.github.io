Compressive Sensing Lattice Dynamics, or [CSLD](https://github.com/LLNL/csld), provides a comprehensive package to study lattice dynamics from first-principles. The interatomic force constants were fitted using the compressive sensing algorithm. CSLD requires Python, C++, and Fortran 90 compilers for installation.
