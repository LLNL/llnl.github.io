The [RADIUSS project](https://software.llnl.gov/radiuss/) has a new [activity portal](https://software.llnl.gov/radiuss/activity/) ([source code for this GitHub action](https://github.com/rseng/opensource-heartbeat-action)) that displays contributors' activities, such as pull requests, issue comments, and releases. Visitors to this page can browse the entire list or filter by activity type to learn more about who contributes to RADIUSS and how they do so. RADIUSS aims to develop and deploy a common base of foundational scientific software with opt-in adoption from LLNL applications in order to reduce long-term software costs and increase agility.
