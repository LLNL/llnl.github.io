RAJA is a software abstraction that systematically encapsulates platform-specific code to enable applications to be portable across diverse hardware architectures without major source code disruption. The RAJA performance suite (RAJAPerf) is designed to explore performance of loop-based computational kernels of the sort found in HPC applications.

In RAJA v0.8.0, the build system was updated to use the latest version of BLT (or close to it). Depending on how one builds RAJA, this could require changes to how information is passed to CMake. The RAJAPerf 0.5.0 release contains several new kernels, plus substantial changes to many CUDA kernel variants to improve performance.
