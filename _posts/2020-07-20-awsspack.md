Amazon Web Services is hosting a two-day [Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) tutorial broadly targeted at HPC users, developers, and user support teams. Each day consists of two 1.5-hour sessions with a 30-minute break in the middle (4-7:30pm CET / 7-10:30pm PT). The first day will cover Spack basics, while the second day will dive deeper on advanced features. [Registration is free.](https://spacktutorialonaws.splashthat.com/)
