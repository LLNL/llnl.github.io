Amazon Web Services hosted a free two-day [Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) tutorial broadly targeted at HPC users, developers, and user support teams. Each day consisted of two 1.5-hour sessions with a 30-minute break in the middle. The first day covered Spack basics, while the second day drilled down on advanced features. Videos from [day 1 (3:19:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os4k8SpZE3s) and [day 2 (3:30:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHTJBWisabo) are available.
