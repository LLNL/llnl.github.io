BLT (Building, Linking, and Testing) is a streamlined CMake build system foundation for developing HPC software. BLT makes it easy to get up and running on a wide range of HPC compilers (e.g., gcc, clang), operating systems (e.g., Linux, Mac OS, Windows), and technologies (e.g., MPI, OpenMP, CUDA). BLT also includes unit testing and benchmarking.

LLNL initially released BLT in 2017, and now v0.2.0 and v0.2.5 are available.
