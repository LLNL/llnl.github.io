LANL led with LLNL contributors, Charliecloud provides user-defined software stacks for HPC centers. It uses Linux user namespaces to run containers with no privileged operations or daemons and minimal configuration changes on center resources. This simple approach avoids most security risks while maintaining access to the performance and functionality already on offer. This release contains two new test suite features:

- Added a script `ch-test` that manages the tests
- Removed the option to use an embedded Bats, eliminating the need for a Git submodule and simplifying packaging
