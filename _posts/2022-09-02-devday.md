Held in a hybrid format for the first time, [LLNL's Developer Day 2022](https://computing.llnl.gov/about/newsroom/developer-day-returns-sixth-year) convened more than 70 people for an agenda of lightning talks, a town hall discussion, and guest speakers. Dev Day provides different ways for the audience to learn about and engage in topics of interest to the developer community—such as lightning talks about small projects, summaries of literature, deep dives into project planning and implementation, discussions of career opportunities and challenges, and networking and brainstorming sessions—and the format varies every year. This year’s event spotlighted guest speakers who explained the impact of unique software projects on their organizations. For instance, Miranda Mundt, a research software engineer at Sandia National Laboratories, described her team’s tiered approach to software quality practices, while Dr. Arun Viswanathan from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory presented work that keeps space missions resilient from cyber threats.
