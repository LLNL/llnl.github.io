At the recent Red Hat Summit in Boston, LLNL's Robin Goldstone discussed open-source technologies and the Sierra supercomputer. Goldstone, an HPC solutions architect, said "open source makes perfect sense" for scalability and performance in an HPC center like LLNL's. She stated, "We have all that visibility and that software. If it doesn't work for our needs, we can make it work for our needs. And then we can give it back to the community because even though people aren't doing things at the scale that we are today, a lot of the things that we're doing really do trickle down and be used by a lot of other people." A transcript of her interview is included with the [video](https://video.cube365.net/c/914449), which runs 15:28.
