[ExaJuGO](https://github.com/LLNL/exajugo) (Exascale Julia Grid Optimization) provides simple Julia scripts for solving AC power flow, AC optimal power flow, and security-constrained AC optimal power flow. These scripts are intended for experimentation with different (possibly, new) methods, formulations, and settings for solving these power system problems. Their implementation, therefore, intentionally avoids excessive encapsulation, which makes other packages difficult to modify by non-developers.
