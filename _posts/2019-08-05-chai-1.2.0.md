The [CHAI library](https://github.com/LLNL/CHAI) handles automatic data migration to different memory spaces behind an array-style interface. It was designed to work with [RAJA](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA) and integrates with it. CHAI may be used with other C++ abstractions as well. [v1.2.0](https://github.com/LLNL/CHAI/releases/tag/v1.2.0) contains support for AMD devices using HIP as well as updates for the 1.0.0 release of [Umpire](https://github.com/LLNL/umpire).
