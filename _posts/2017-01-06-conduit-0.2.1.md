Conduit provides APIs focused on simplifying data exchange in HPC simulations. It provides an intuitive model for describing hierarchical scientific data in C++, C, Fortran, and Python and is used for data coupling between packages in-core, serialization, and I/O tasks.

The [0.2.1 version](https://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/v0.2.1/) is primarily a bug fix release, which includes:

- Fixes to support static builds, including on BGQ using xlc and gcc
- Bug fixes for Blueprint verify routines.
- The elimination of separate Fortran libs by moving Fortran symbols into their associated main libs
