UMAP is a library that provides an mmap()-like interface to a simple, user- space page fault handler based on the `userfaultfd` Linux feature (starting with 4.3 linux kernel). The use case is to have an application specific buffer of pages cached from a large file, i.e. out-of-core execution using memory map.
