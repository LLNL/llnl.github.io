[CompilerGPT](https://github.com/LLNL/CompilerGPT) is a framework that submits compiler optimization reports (i.e., Clang) and the source code to an LLM. The LLM is prompted to prioritize the findings in the optimization reports and then to make changes in the code accordingly. An automated test harness validates the changes. The test harness provides feedback to the LLM on any errors that were introduced to the code base.
