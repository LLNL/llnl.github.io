The Assured Timing Detector ([ATD](https://github.com/LLNL/ATD)) software provides an implementation in C++ of an adaptable, model-based system for monitoring a timing signal for anomalies versus a reference time source ensemble. This system is designed to be model-based, adaptive, and customizable. A companion status display software package, [ATD-SD](https://github.com/LLNL/ATD-SD), is also available for use with this software.
