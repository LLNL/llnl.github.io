This summer, LLNL's RADIUSS team conducted a series of tutorials in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS), demonstrating how to use several GPU-ready projects in the cloud and on premises. The tutorials were open to everyone and held every week throughout August. Participants followed along on their own AWS EC2 instance (provided). No previous was experience necessary. Materials are accessible on the [RADIUSS website](https://software.llnl.gov/radiuss/event/2022/07/07/radiuss-on-aws/).
