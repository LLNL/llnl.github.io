[Version 3.1](https://glvis.org/download/) of GLVis, a lightweight OpenGL tool for accurate and flexible finite element visualization, is now available.

The goal of GLVis is to enable research and development of general finite element discretization algorithms through accurate OpenGL visualization, and tight integration with the [MFEM](http://mfem.org) library. It has many features, including:

- Support for arbitrary high-order and NURBS meshes.
- Visualization of parallel meshes and solutions.
- Accurate functional representation of many finite elements.
- Server mode accepting multiple socket connections.

Some of the new additions in version 3.1 are:

- Support for visualization of non-conforming meshes and grid functions.
- New visualization of vector fields on surface meshes.
- Improved build system, command line options and PDF screenshots.

GLVis is freely available under LGPL 2.1.
