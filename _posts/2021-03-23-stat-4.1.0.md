[STAT](https://github.com/LLNL/STAT), the Stack Trace Analysis Tool, is a highly scalable, lightweight tool that gathers and merges stack traces from all of the processes of a parallel application to form call graph prefix trees. STAT generates two prefix trees termed 2D-trace-space and 3D-trace-space-time. STAT's source code also includes STATBench, a tool to emulate STAT. STATBench enables the benchmarking of STAT on arbitrary machine architectures and applications by fully utilizing parallel resources and generating artificial stack traces. Version 4.1.0 adds DynInst 10.2 support and initial rocgdb support.
