title: "Kripke 1.2.4 Released"
categories: release

Kripke is a simple, scalable, 3D Sn deterministic particle transport code. Its primary purpose is to research how data layout, programming paradigms and architectures effect the implementation and performance of Sn transport. A main goal of Kripke is investigating how different data-layouts effect instruction, thread and task level parallelism, and what the implications are on overall solver performance. v1.2.4 changes the software license to BSD 3-clause.
