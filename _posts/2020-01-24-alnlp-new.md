A new [Active Learning framework for Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/LLNL/al_nlp) (AL NLP) repository contains code implementing an active learning loop for natural language processing of pathology reports related to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Pilot 3 project. [This NCI project](https://www.llnl.gov/news/multi-institutional-meeting-centers-making-%E2%80%98impossible%E2%80%99-possible-cancer-research) is a population-level pilot aimed at applying deep learning and other advanced computing technologies to cancer surveillance data in order to predict patient outcomes.
