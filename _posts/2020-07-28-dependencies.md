title: "New Dependencies Page on Software Portal"
categories:
---

The [Visualize section](/visualize/) of this website has grown to include a [new page](/visualize/dependencies/) that visualizes our software catalog's dependencies. LLNL software repos are shown in the context of repositories with dependencies, External Packages, and internal packages. You can move the slider to change the connections between repos, organizations, and dependencies as well as click on a circle to isolate its specific connections in an expansion panel on the right side of the page. This work, which enables us to learn more about our repos and how they are related, was done by our 2020 summer intern.
