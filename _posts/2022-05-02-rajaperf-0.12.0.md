The RAJA performance suite ([RAJAPerf](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAPerf)) is designed to explore performance of loop-based computational kernels found in HPC applications. It is used to assess, monitor, and compare runtime performance of kernels implemented using RAJA and variants implemented using standard or vendor-supported parallel programming models directly. The v0.12.0 release adds new command line options, basic MPI support, and new kernels, as well as updated versions of [RAJA](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA) and [BLT](https://github.com/LLNL/blt) submodules.
