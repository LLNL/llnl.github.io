The Performance Optimisation and Productivity blog published a [post](https://pop-coe.eu/blog/tool-time-caliper-a-performance-analysis-toolbox-in-a-library) by LLNL's David Boehme, who described the open source [Caliper](https://github.com/LLNL/Caliper) program instrumentation and performance measurement framework. Caliper can be used for lightweight always-on profiling or advanced performance engineering use cases, such as tracing, monitoring, and auto-tuning. It is primarily aimed at HPC applications, but works for any C/C++/Fortran program on Unix/Linux. The blog post outlines Caliper's instrumentation and API with examples.
