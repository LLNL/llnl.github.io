[CHAI](https://github.com/LLNL/CHAI) is a C++ library providing an array object that can be used transparently in multiple memory spaces. CHAI can be used standalone, but is best when paired with the RAJA library, which has built-in CHAI integration that takes care of everything. This release includes a major refactoring of the integration with the [RAJA](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/) performance portability layer. CHAI now provides an `ENABLE_RAJA_PLUGIN` option that will build a plugin for RAJA enabling automatic data migration when CHAI and RAJA are linked in the same application.
