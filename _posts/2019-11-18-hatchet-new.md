[Hatchet](https://github.com/LLNL/hatchet) is a Python-based library that allows Pandas dataframes to be indexed by structured tree and graph data. It is intended for analyzing performance data that has a hierarchy (for example, serial or parallel profiles that represent calling context trees, call graphs, nested regionsâ€™ timers, etc.). Hatchet implements various operations to analyze a single hierarchical data set or compare multiple data sets, and its API facilitates analyzing such data programmatically. See the [documentation](https://hatchet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information including installation steps.
