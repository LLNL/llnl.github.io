[INQ](https://github.com/LLNL/inq) is an engine for electronic structure calculations. It can work in three ways: as a standalone electronic structure code, as a library to implement complex electronic structure methods, or as a proxy-app to evaluate the performance of electronic structure algorithms in high-performance computing platforms. It concentrates on algorithms as a portability hardware layer, generic types and flexibility of usage.
