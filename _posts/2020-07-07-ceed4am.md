As part of the [Exascale Computing Project (ECP)](https://www.exascaleproject.org/), the [Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations (CEED)](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/) is a research partnership between two U.S. Department of Energy laboratories and five universities. LLNL leads the Center. All of [CEED's software](https://github.com/ceed/) is open source.

CEED will hold its 4th annual meeting on August 11-12, virtually using ECP Zoom for videoconferencing and Slack for side discussions. The goal of the meeting is to report on the progress in the Center; deepen existing and establish new connections with ECP hardware vendors, ECP software technologies projects, and other collaborators; plan project activities; and brainstorm/work as a group to make technical progress. In addition to gathering together many of the CEED researchers, the meeting will include representatives of the ECP management, hardware vendors, software technology and other interested projects. Additional [meeting information](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/ceed4am/) is available on the CEED website, and [free registration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqJElu6CIhTLjAzB4Tt-oX1Faa9qJfPvBZyKZKGyYQ3_SpXA/viewform?usp=send_form) closes on August 7.
