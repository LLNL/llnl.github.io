For the LLNL-led MFEM project, which has been open source for more than a decade, community collaboration has helped evolve this C++ software library into a robust mathematical engine for scientific simulations. [MFEM](https://mfem.org/), which stands for Modular Finite Element Methods, provides algorithms that break down high-order mathematical equations into discrete operations, improving a simulation’s performance while reducing its computational cost. The software is used in large-scale simulations of scientific phenomena and processes including additive manufacturing, biotechnology, design optimization, electromagnetics, fluid dynamics, nuclear energy, structural mechanics, and more. “The community is a catalyst for our annual workshops,” stated principal investigator Tzanio Kolev. “We are motivated by the challenges they face and the successes they have.”

The MFEM team [recently held their annual workshop](https://computing.llnl.gov/about/newsroom/mfem-workshop-2023). If you missed the event, the [2023 agenda](https://mfem.org/workshop/) web  page links to speakers' slides. Videos of the talks are in production and will be posted soon.
