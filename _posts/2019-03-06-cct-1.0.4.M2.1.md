The Coda Calibration Tool (CCT) calculates reliable moment magnitudes for small- to moderate-sized seismic events. After the January 25 release, you spoke and we listened! This is a minor bugfix and feature update release based on community feedback. Changes include:

- Make optimization for Path correction significantly more aggressive
- Reweight GT spectra with stress drop values defined to be 1.0 across all frequencies
- Make noise floor display consistent across the board
- Show 'bad' autopicks so humans get more feedback on what the autopicker is doing
- Remove AP pick if a human moves them (consider as 'reviewed')
