The 0.2.0 release includes:

- Changes to clarify concepts in the ``conduit::Node`` API
- Added ``const`` access to ``conduit::Node``â€™s children and a new ``NodeConstIterator``
- Added support for building on Windows
- Added ``conduit::blueprint`` verify support and examples for the mcarray and mesh protocols
- Added extensive HDF5 I/O support to ``conduit::relay`` for reading and writing between HDF5 files and conduit Node trees
