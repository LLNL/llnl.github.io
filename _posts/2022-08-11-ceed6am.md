As part of the Exascale Computing Project ([ECP](https://www.exascaleproject.org/)), the Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations ([CEED](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/)) is a research partnership between two U.S. Department of Energy laboratories and five universities. LLNL leads the Center. All of [CEED's software](https://github.com/ceed/) is open source.

CEED held its sixth annual meeting ([CEED6AM](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/ceed6am/)) on August 9-11 in a hybrid format: in-person at the [Siebel Center for Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus in Urbana and virtually using ECP Zoom for videoconferencing and Slack for side discussions.
