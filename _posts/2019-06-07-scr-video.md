The [SCR software framework](https://github.com/LLNL/scr) provides efficient, scalable checkpoint/restart capability for simulation codes, ensuring faster time to solution and allowing scientists to focus on the science. SCR caches checkpoint data in storage on the compute nodes of a Linux cluster to provide a fast, scalable checkpoint restart capability for MPI codes.

In [this video](https://youtu.be/_r6svl_eAns), LLNL's [Kathryn Mohror](https://github.com/kathrynmohror) explains how SCR works. Physicist Denise Hinkel then discusses how SCR has impacted simulation capabilities at the National Ignition Facility.
