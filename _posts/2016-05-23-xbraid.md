title: "XBraid: Parallel Time Integration with Multigrid"
categories: story
---

LLNL scientists have developed an open-source, non-intrusive, and general purpose parallel-in-time code, XBraid. This tool solves for all time steps simultaneously with the help of a new multilevel algorithm and the massively parallel processing capabilities of current and future high-performance computers.

Learn more on the [LLNL Computing website](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/parallel-time-integration-multigrid), and download the software on [GitHub](https://github.com/XBraid/xbraid).
