The Linux Foundation's Open Source Leadership Summit occurred in Half Moon Bay, California, on Thursday, March 14. LLNL's [Todd Gamblin](https://github.com/tgamblin) presented "Open Source in the Exascale Computing Project: Building a Software Ecosystem for Science." Check out the [conference schedule](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-leadership-summit-2019/program/schedule/).

This presentation covered the challenges of building software for machines that don't exist yet, and how government laboratories, academia, and industry are collaborating to build a highly optimized software distribution. From deploying services like GitLab CI and JupyterHub in high-security HPC centers, challenges for architecture-specific containers, the use of Spack to package and distribute optimized binaries, and the social hurdles of scientists and developers working together, this talk summarized the open source challenges in DOE's largest-ever HPC software project.
