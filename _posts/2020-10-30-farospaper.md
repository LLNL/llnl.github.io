A team of LLNL computer scientists and a collaborator from Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) won the Best Paper Award at the International Workshop on OpenMP (IWOMP) 2020 in September. Giorgis Georgakoudis, Ignacio Laguna, Tom Scogland (LLNL), and Johannes Doerfert (ANL) accepted the award for their paper, “[FAROS: A Framework to Analyze OpenMP Compilation Through Benchmarking and Compiler Optimization Analysis](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58144-2_1).” The paper showcases the new Livermore-developed framework, [FAROS](https://github.com/LLNL/FAROS), which pinpoints missing compiler optimizations due to OpenMP compilation and measures the impact on performance. FAROS is the result of a previously funded Laboratory Directed Research and Development Feasibility Study, which was led by Georgakoudis.
