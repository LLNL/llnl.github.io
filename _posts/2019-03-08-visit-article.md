Software development is often a story of teamwork and determination. It’s a tale of persistence through failure toward, ideally, success. At LLNL, this story plays out in countless daily iterations as software teams strive to advance the Lab’s national security mission. When it comes to supporting both stockpile stewardship and foundational science, the VisIt visualization tool is the backbone of LLNL’s computer simulation analysis and visualization capabilities.

For the VisIt team, migration is modernization. Some of VisIt’s original development technologies are now considered ancient. But migrating 2 million lines of code is easier said than done. [Go behind the scenes](https://computing.llnl.gov/newsroom/great-migration-visit-moves-subversion-github) as an LLNL team discusses the logistics, challenges, and benefits of VisIt’s complicated move to GitHub.
