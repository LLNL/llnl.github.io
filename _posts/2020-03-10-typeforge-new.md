[Typeforge](https://github.com/LLNL/typeforge) is a tool for type refactoring of C/C++ programs. It enables users to change the type of any variable and automatically determines all necessary additional (i.e., type-dependent) changes. It guarantees the syntactic and semantic correctness of the generated code.
