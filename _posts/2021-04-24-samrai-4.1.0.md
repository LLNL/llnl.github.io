[SAMRAI](https://github.com/LLNL/SAMRAI) (Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement Application Infrastructure) is an object-oriented C++ software library that enables exploration of numerical, algorithmic, parallel computing, and software issues associated with applying structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR) technology in large-scale parallel application development. The current release features a new alias `tbox::ResourceAllocator` to clean up the API for usage of Umpire allocators in pdat classes. This provides a valid type name that can be used and passed through the pdat classes' APIs regardless of the status of the configuration.
