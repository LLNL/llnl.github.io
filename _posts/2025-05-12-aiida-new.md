[AiiDA Flux Scheduler](https://github.com/LLNL/aiida-flux-scheduler) is plugin for the LLNL developed Flux scheduler. The plugin works at the same level as the slurm scheduler plugin. AiiDA will use the plugin to submit individual jobs to the Flux scheduler and retrieve the jobs when they are done.
