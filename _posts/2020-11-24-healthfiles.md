title: "New Templates for Community Health Files"
categories:
---

Our [.github repo](https://github.com/LLNL/.github) houses file templates and other content that can be used by LLNL open source projects. The goal is to help standardize the presentation and organization of certain types of content across the LLNL organization. New this month are [community health files](https://github.com/LLNL/.github/tree/main/community-health) that developers can copy and/or modify as needed to ensure their repos adhere to certain guidelines regarding licenses and other aspects of releasing and maintaining open source software. New files include Contributing Guidelines, a Notice, a Code of Conduct, and templates for opening issues and submitting pull requests. More information is available on the [.github README](https://github.com/LLNL/.github/blob/main/README.md).
