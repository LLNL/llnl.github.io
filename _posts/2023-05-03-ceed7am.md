As part of the Exascale Computing Project ([ECP](https://www.exascaleproject.org/)), the Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations ([CEED](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/)) is a research partnership between two U.S. Department of Energy laboratories and five universities. LLNL leads the Center. All of [CEED's software](https://github.com/ceed/) is open source.

CEED will hold its seventh and final annual meeting ([CEED7AM](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/ceed7am/)) on August 1-3 at LLNL and virtually via Zoom and Slack.
