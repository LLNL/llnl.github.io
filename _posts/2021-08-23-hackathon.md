Each new season brings another hackathon, and LLNL's summer event [took place](https://computing.llnl.gov/about/newsroom/summer-hackathon-tradition-continues-virtually) on August 12–13. The event was sponsored by the Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC) and Livermore Computing (LC) divisions and organized by Stephanie Brink (CASC), Tammy Dahlgren (LC), and Stephen Herbein (LC). Additionally, Computing’s summer interns were encouraged to participate in the event. Ian Lee, open source advocate and Computing’s Alternate Organizational Information System Security Officer, kicked off the hackathon with a presentation titled “When a Hackathon Project Ends…Does It Make a Sound?” He gave participants a larger picture beyond the event’s concentrated 24 hours, detailing how he has shepherded hackathon projects into real-world applications with benefits to a wide group of users and developers across the Lab.
