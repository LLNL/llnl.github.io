Held since 2012, LLNL's [hackathons](https://computing.llnl.gov/newsroom/hackathons) are 24-hour opportunities to brainstorm, foster creativity, prototype, and explore. Participants work in groups or individually and often strive to learn new skills, programming languages, and tools in service to LLNLâ€™s missions. Like the spring hackathon earlier this year, the summer event (August 6-7) will be held virtually using WebEx and Mattermost for collaboration. LLNL sponsors are Livermore Computing and the Center for Applied Scientific Computing. [Registration {% raw %}<i class="fa fa-lock"></i>{% endraw %}](https://hackathon.llnl.gov) closes on July 31.
