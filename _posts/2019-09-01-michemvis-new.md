Domain-specific applications often require specially designed visualization systems. [MI-ChemVis](https://github.com/LLNL/MI-ChemVis) is a browser-based visualization of chemistry papers, specifically morphology, material, and chemical data extracted from them. The UI is made with nanomaterial synthesis papers in mind.
