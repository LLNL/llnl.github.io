ElMerFold researchers produced high-quality 3D structure predictions for more than 41 million proteins—at a scale and speed previously thought impossible—using LLNL’s El Capitan, the world’s fastest supercomputer. This work, performed prior to El Capitan being dedicated to national security work, sets a new standard for large-scale scientific AI and enables critical next steps in the development of OpenFold3, an open source alternative to DeepMind’s AlphaFold 3. The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the developers of AlphaFold, highlighting the societal importance of computational protein structure prediction. The OpenFold models are publicly available and openly licensed, making them an essential tool for democratizing access to cutting-edge protein-structure prediction.
