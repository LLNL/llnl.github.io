DataRaceBench is a benchmark suite designed to systematically and quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of data race detection tools. It includes a set of microbenchmarks with and without data races. Parallelism is represented by OpenMP directives. This version adds data race ground truth encoding into all microbenchmarks, new C/C++ microbenchmarks and Fortran microbenchmarks, new high-precision evaluation scripts, and more.
