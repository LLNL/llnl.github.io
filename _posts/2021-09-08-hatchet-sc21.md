The Python-based library [Hatchet](https://github.com/hatchet/hatchet) will be part of a new Supercomputing 2021 (SC21) tutorial on performance tools. Hatchet allows Pandas dataframes to be indexed by structured tree and graph data and is intended for analyzing hierarchical performance data. The development team has released a video titled ["User-Centric Automated Performance Analysis of Hybrid Parallel Programs"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeZwTpMQHXw) to preview the tutorial and give attendees an idea of what to expect. [SC21](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/) will take place in a hybrid format on November 14â€“19.
