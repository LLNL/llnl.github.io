zfp is a library for compressed numerical arrays that support high-throughput read and write random access. zfp also supports streaming compression of integer and floating-point data, e.g., for applications that read and write large data sets to and from disk. zfp is primarily written in C and C++ but also includes Python and Fortran bindings.

This release includes these additions to the code:
- Support for reversible (lossless) compression of floating-point and integer data
- Methods for serializing and deserializing zfp's compressed arrays
- Python bindings for compressing NumPy arrays
- Fortran bindings to zfp's high-level C API
