The [ISC](https://www.isc-hpc.com/) (formerly known as the International Supercomputing Conference) caters to the hardware and software demands of global research centers and businesses in the fields of HPC, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics. Instead of meeting in Frankfurt, Germany, this year the conference will be held online during June 22-24. Stay tuned for more information as the program is finalized.
