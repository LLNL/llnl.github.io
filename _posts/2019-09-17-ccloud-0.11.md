LANL led with LLNL contributors, Charliecloud provides user-defined software stacks for HPC centers. It uses Linux user namespaces to run containers with no privileged operations or daemons and minimal configuration changes on center resources. This simple approach avoids most security risks while maintaining access to the performance and functionality already on offer.

This release contains new features along with documentation and test suite improvements:
- Charliecloud is now in Fedora and EPEL
- `ch-grow`: support `ARG` instruction
- `ch-run`: `/etc/resolv.conf` on the host is now optional
