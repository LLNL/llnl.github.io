At the annual supercomputing conference (SC19) in Denver, Colorado, [Spack](https://spack.io/) events were held each day. As a reflection of its grassroots heritage, nine sessions were planned by more than a dozen thought leaders from seven organizations, including three DOE laboratories and Sylabs, the company behind Singularity. Thirteen thousand six hundred conference attendees had the chance to learn about Spack from two meet-and-greets, three birds-of-a-feather meetings, three papers, and more. This HPCwire article describes Spack's history, functionality, impact, and user community through the many [Spack-related events](https://spack.io/spack-at-sc19/) at SC19.
