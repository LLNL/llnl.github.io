[MTtime](https://github.com/LLNL/mttime) (Time Domain Moment Tensor Inversion in Python) is a python package developed for time domain inversion of complete seismic waveform data to obtain the seismic moment tensor. It supports deviatoric and full moment tensor inversions, and 1-D and 3-D basis Green's functions. [MTtime documentation](https://mttime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and a [working example](https://github.com/LLNL/mttime/tree/master/examples/notebooks) are provided.
