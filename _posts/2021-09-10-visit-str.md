The [VisIt](https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/) visualization and analysis tool has supported scalable, high-quality evaluation of simulation results for over 20 years. A Research Highlight article in the latest issue of *Science & Technology Review* describes the software's history and importance. Eric Brugger, who has worked on VisIt since its inception, states, “Our software is used broadly throughout the Department of Energy complex, at universities, and at other supercomputing centers. It’s running on some of the world’s most powerful machines. VisIt strikes a balance between application support and capability development that appeals to the larger HPC community.” Read ["Visualization Software Stands the Test of Time"](https://str.llnl.gov/2021-05/brugger) on the *S&TR* website.
