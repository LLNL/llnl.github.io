ScrubJay, an open-source performance data analysis tool, helps ensure that the Laboratoryâ€™s HPC center lives up to its name. Check out this new [writeup](https://str.llnl.gov/2018-10/gimenez) in LLNL's magazine, *Science & Technology Review*. Fork the repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/LLNL/ScrubJay).

ScrubJay is an intuitive, scalable framework for automatic analysis of disparate HPC data. ScrubJay decouples the task of *specifying* data relationships from the task of *analyzing* data. Domain experts can store reusable transformations that describe the projection of one domain onto another. The program also automates performance analysis. Analysts provide a query over logical domains of interest, and ScrubJay automatically derives the needed steps to transform raw measurements. This process makes large-scale analysis tractable and reproducible, thus providing crucial insights into HPC facilities.
