[Gula](https://github.com/LLNL/Gula) a 3D model of the Gula Regional Hospital, a hypothetical facility for studying the protection of high-activity radioactive sources against theft or sabotage. Description:

> The facility includes 2 stories above ground and a basement. The basement contains two high-activity radiation sources, a blood irradiator (assumed to be using a cesium-137 or cobalt-60 source), and a teletherapy device (assumed to be cobalt-60) for treating cancer patients. These parts of the facility are hardened from a physical security perspective. The high-activity radiation sources are protected in keeping with ORS and international consensus. This includes systems for access control, physical protection, video monitoring, and radiation detection.  The combination of these systems ensures a robust detection and response against external and insider threats of theft or sabotage. The facility also contains a security department with a central alarm station (CAS), medical emergency room, treatment facilities, office space, etc.
