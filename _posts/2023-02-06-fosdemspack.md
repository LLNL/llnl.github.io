FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas, and collaborate. The [Spack](https://spack.io) team had three presentations at this year's event in February. If you missed them, you can watch the videos here:

- Automating a rolling binary release for Spack: Scaling a modern CI workflow to a large distribution ([abstract and video (21:28)](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/rolling_release_spack/))
- How the Spack package manager tames the stat storm ([abstract and video (24:28)](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/spack_stat_storm/))
