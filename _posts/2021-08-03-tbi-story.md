Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) affect millions of people each year, whether from car accidents, sports injuries, or on the battlefield. LLNL is part of the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) project, which aims to uncover fundamental new insights into how to diagnose and treat TBI as well as help deliver precision medicine to patients using advanced supercomputing and machine learning technologies. To this end, researchers have developed the open source [MaPPeRTrac](https://github.com/LLNL/MaPPeRTrac): the Massively Parallel, Portable, and Reproducible Tractography brain tractography workflow. MaPPeRTrac incorporates novel technologies to simplify and accelerate neuroimaging research.
