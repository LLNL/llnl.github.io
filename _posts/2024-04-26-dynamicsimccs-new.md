[DynamicSimCCS](https://github.com/LLNL/DynamicSimCCS) accompanies the manuscript "Advancing carbon capture from bench to pilot scale using dynamic similitude" (link not available yet) accepted for publication at _Cell Reports Physical Science_. The code solves for the one-dimensional concentration and temperature distribution within a carbon capture column using a homogenized absorber model. These solutions are compared to experimental data.
