The Coda Calibration Tool (CCT) calculates reliable moment magnitudes for small- to moderate-sized seismic events. This release contains performance improvements and other updates, namely:
- Added REST endpoint on the envelope service to request to just get stacked files back rather than envelopes
- 10â€“30% performance improvements when making many (>10K) high sample rate (>100hz) envelopes at once
