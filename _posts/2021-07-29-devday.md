Held virtually on July 15, our [fifth annual Developer Day](https://computing.llnl.gov/about/newsroom/dev-day-makes-most-virtual-format) was a success. The morning session included lightning talks, a security-focused technical deep dive, and “quick takes” on remote-development resources. The afternoon session provided presentations about career paths and the Lab’s diversity and inclusion goals, capped by a career development panel discussion co-sponsored by the Data Science Institute.
