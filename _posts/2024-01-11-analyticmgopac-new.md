[AnalyticMGOpac](https://github.com/LLNL/AnalyticMGOpac) provides an analytic opacity integrator for multigroup calculations. This C++14 code numerically integrates the opacity formulas for the test problem described in the paper "A Family of Multi-Dimensional Thermal Radiative Transfer Test Problems."  (Paper abstract and link are not available at this time.)
