The Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations ([CEED](https://github.com/CEED)) is part of the Department of Energy’s Exascale Computing Project ([ECP](https://www.exascaleproject.org/)). The Center helps applications leverage future architectures by developing discretization algorithms that better exploit the hardware and deliver a significant performance gain over conventional methods. CEED regularly releases milestone (MS) [reports](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/pubs/) to document progress and ensure transparency throughout its multi-year efforts.

The [MS-35 report](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/docs/ceed-ms35-report.pdf) details the CEED accomplishments towards the following goals:

- Work with vendors to port and run CEED benchmarks on early access systems for Aurora (Argonne National Lab) and Frontier (Oak Ridge National Lab)
- Make the best BP/BK implementations from Nek, MFEM, libParanumal, and the external community available in [libCEED](https://github.com/CEED/libCEED)
- Organize the next CEED Annual meeting ([CEED4AM](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/ceed4am/))
- Optimize the CEED applications and miniapps for the Aurora and Frontier architectures
