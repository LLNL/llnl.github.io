# Project Logos

The home and /radiuss pages display a logo next to each repo when they appear under the topic categories. This feature does not apply to the /catalog view.

If a repo has its own logo, that should display. If not, then its organization's avatar should display. Every repo should have one logo or avatar; no repo should be "empty." Organization avatars are pulled from GitHub.

Repo logo files should follow a naming convention and be added to the directory. All files must be in .png format.
- Repository logo: `<repo_name>.png`
- Directory: `/assets/images/logos/<org name>`
